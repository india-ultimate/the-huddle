      <title>Attack Both Sidelines</title>

      <description>Offenses used to look to get the disc near the sideline and then attack from there. Teams didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be right on the sideline—with a foot on the edge hoping to attack from there, but a vertical stack offense looks to move the disc to ~5-10 yards from one sideline, take a good long look up field and then swing it around and try the other sideline. This offense can still be effective and all teams should have the ability to use this, even as simply a change of pace.</description>

      <title>Depends On The Offensive System</title>

      <description>The value of the sideline space depends on the offense. In a horizontal offense, the sideline limits your options. In a vertical offense, it&amp;rsquo;s a great place to be—until it isn&amp;rsquo;t.
Horizontal
From a downfield cutter&amp;rsquo;s perspective, one unique benefit of the horizontal offense is that it lets you make cuts across the mark. With so much uncrowded horizontal space between the cutters and the thrower, you can threaten an open-side cut, then change direction to receive a breakmark pass.</description>

      <title>Drilling For The Sideline Trap</title>

      <description>An organized approach to sideline situations gives the offense a great advantage. For example: a well-isolated huck down the line or a series of swings to the breakside. Unprepared and against a good defense, a team facing a sideline trap will likely turn the disc over. I would challenge any team to spend more time practicing from the sideline. Most teams have only one play for the sideline, and many for a centered disc.</description>

      <title>Field Spacing &amp; Offense</title>
      <link>https://the-huddle.indiaultimate.org/issue-016/field-spacing-offense/</link>

      <description>Field spacing depends on the offense your team is running. This is dictated in part by the defensive strengths of the team you are playing and in part by your own team&amp;rsquo;s strengths.
In the mid-to-late 1990&amp;rsquo;s, the offense of choice for us (Furious) was the vertical stack. In the vertical O, the idea is to move the disc to one sideline or the other and flood the stack to the other side of the field, thus isolating a cutter.</description>

      <title>No Room For Error</title>
      <link>https://the-huddle.indiaultimate.org/issue-016/no-room-for-error/</link>

      <description>Typically, our offense thinks of the sideline as a trap if we are being forced to that sideline. Given the right thrower, it could be a land of opportunity as it is much easier to destroy a defense with one break throw from the trap sideline. But, given that there are few throwers that skilled on a team, as a whole, the sideline is viewed as a trap.
The sideline is a trap because it gives throwers who do not consistently break the mark a very small window to work with when throwing to an in-cutter.</description>

      <description>Moving the disc does one of three things:
Gains ground (i.e. attacks) Moves you to a better place from which to attack Maintains possession Because there is less room, the sideline can often be a harder place from which to do 2 and 3. But if you can make space for your teammates, it can also be an ideal place from which to attack.
As always, personnel and approach determines much of what you do.</description>

      <title>The Extra Defender</title>
      <link>https://the-huddle.indiaultimate.org/issue-016/the-extra-defender/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always viewed the sideline as an extra defender that can be utilized by the defense to gain an advantage, especially in a vertical stack offense. As the disc moves to the sideline, the thrower and cutters have less viable space to work with, which restricts them to two kinds of viable cuts; a deep cut and an under cut. For a defender, shutting down these two sideline options simplifies the task that is presented when the disc is in the middle; a deep cut, an under cut, and a break mark.</description>

      <title>Three Lane Theory</title>
      <link>https://the-huddle.indiaultimate.org/issue-016/three-lane-theory/</link>

      <guid>https://the-huddle.indiaultimate.org/issue-016/three-lane-theory/</guid>
      <description>I tend to think of the Ultimate field in three lanes running down the field. When the disc is in one of the side lanes, you really only have that lane and the middle lane available, as throws to the far lane are quite risky. Sometimes focusing on just two lanes can mean that you reduce the complexity for the thrower and the offense, and it limits the angles that poachers can come from.</description>

      <title>Yardage Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://the-huddle.indiaultimate.org/issue-016/yardage-opportunities/</link>

      <guid>https://the-huddle.indiaultimate.org/issue-016/yardage-opportunities/</guid>
      <description>The sideline is a great space to look to gain yardage. If your dump can beat his defender up the line, it should be a relatively easy pass to space in front of him, and he can then potentially hit a deep throw. This is probably the best way to get off a high percentage huck (and doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily need to happen on the sideline). It&amp;rsquo;s easy for the downfield cutters to time a deep cut when they see this up-line cut developing, and the thrower can use his momentum to get off a big throw.</description>
