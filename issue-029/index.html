        <p>&quot;How did they see that?&quot;</p>
<p>Some players, whether through experience or natural talent, seem to
understand what is happening on the field at all times. Those players
have an advantage with the disc in their hands as they are able to pick
out open players, even if the cutter didn't know they were open! They
tend to be intelligent cutters and savvy defenders. Why?Â </p>
<p>How did you develop field vision? Who have you played with or against
that had great field vision? How would you define this ability? How can
it be taught, or learned by a motivated player?</p>

    <p>Field vision is the ability to understand the dynamics of the opposition&rsquo;s
offense or defense despite being embroiled in a battle against it. Every team
has players who see plays happen/develop (be it from on the pitch or the
sideline), and compile the information to start the next point with the
knowledge they just took on board (and, importantly, can dispense it to their
teammates). It is these adaptive players that win tight matches.</p>
<p>The natural ability to analyze mid-experience is difficult to develop but not
impossible. Two simple steps are watch as much Ultimate as you can and then
help to coach. Moving from playing to coaching forces players to look at the
game in a new light; not only do you need to see everything that happens on
the pitch, but now you have the chance to do it because you&rsquo;re on the
sideline.</p>
<p>Personally, I find it very difficult to analyze a game as it develops when I&rsquo;m
playing a part in it. My mind needs to focus on the immediate â€” on the task at
hand at that very second. If I want more than that I need to get off the
field, watch a little and then figure it out â€” usually time that I do not
have. It wasn&rsquo;t until I started coaching that I began to realize how much I
had been missing.</p>

    <p>Good field vision can be described as a contrast between being somebody with
good field sense and somebody who has &ldquo;visionary throws.&rdquo; If you have ever
been called &ldquo;visionary&rdquo; I bet that it wasn&rsquo;t a compliment.</p>
<p>Most of the time people who are described as having good field vision are
players who have a general sense of what is going on with all 14 players on
the field. This is broken down into four things: a good understanding of
passing lanes, a strong mastery of various throwing skills, a knowledge of
what the offensive system is trying to attack and what the defense is
currently doing to stop that attack. Anybody who has a visionary throw has
gotten away with a dumb decision because of a terrific throw and probably bad
defense, i.e. it shouldn&rsquo;t have worked but it did. A player with good field
vision can close his or her eyes and describe how all 13 other players are
positioned and where they intend to go.</p>
<p>When an O point starts there is usually a string called and somebody with good
field vision is going to be able to quickly assess whether the called play is
on or off based on how hard people are running down and what lanes they are
in. This is true for both the thrower and the cutters. As a cutter you should
be identifying who is covering you and who is poaching the lanes so that you
can set up a good cut if you are in the string or figure out how to engage
your player if you are not. When you are a thrower it is more important to be
aware of all 7 defenders so that you can make the right throw. This is true in
all non-string situations as well and you should be aware of the surroundings
at all times.</p>
<p>As a thrower there are 3 types of thinkers:</p>
<ol>
<li>New players can focus on the their immediate target and assess whether that player is open or not. This is a binary decision of whether to throw or not to throw. Ideally, the player will be able to see a poach and not make a mistake, but there is little to be gained by merely not throwing to somebody who is double covered. This is the minimal level of success.</li>
<li>Moderate players can adjust to a secondary defender and see the poach who is affecting it. If the second player is in their field of vision they should spot that uncovered O player and throw to them since they are uncovered. This is good because it allows the player not to make a mistake and advance the disc, but does not take full advantage of poaches.</li>
<li>Great players can see a poach and know what is happening outside of their field of vision. This is where great field vision is most powerful because it allows a player to know where to attack after only looking at half the field. This leads to quick decisions and massive shifts in the focus of the offense, which is devastating to the defense. Joe Montana and LeBron James are cited as having this kind of vision. They know what pass to throw before they look because they see a defender doing something other than guarding the prescribed player. They might not see their teammate, but they can see that they are undefended.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the third scenario the thrower knows what is going to happen one throw
ahead of time. In normal offensive flow this means knowing where the next pass
is going to go before it&rsquo;s thrown, which will help with spacing and clearing.
Also, if the give and go is a part of the offense then a player needs to know
when to use it and when it would cut off upfield flow. Ideally a thrower would
know where the huck is likely to be generated. Is it going to happen after a
swing to the dead side or off an up line dump cut? In both situations it will
enable better timing on the part of the cutters and throwers.</p>
<p>On occasion it is up to a thrower to create some offense. More often than not
this is in a zone where the offensive players are working to create good
spacing with various defensive set-ups. The thrower needs to throw to a space
where the offensive player can get to the disc well ahead of any defender. In
man to man defense, this same theory can apply to stoppages of play, but it is
more common in zone where the throw initiates most of the movement. To do
this, the thrower needs to assess the defense and, via a fake or other
gesture/positioning, cause some defensive movement that will open up the
optimal target. When this happens the throw must be to a place where a
teammate can get it but no defender can. This requires a strong understanding
of what the offense is attacking versus what the defense is taking away.
Examples of this are throws through gaps in the cup, short upside down flips
over the top or deep hammers to wings.</p>
<p>I see Ultimate moving toward an NBA/NFL defensive system where the D is trying
to make the other team use their secondary option most of the time. This is
achieved by taking away certain parts of the field or double teaming a great
individual. If we then get into a pattern of O players trying to outthink a D
line, with guessing games on both sides, I believe that it will be a major
advancement for the sport. Think about Peyton Manning vs. the main linebacker
or safety and you will get the picture of where we are going.</p>
<p>Putting your head down and running hard against your matchup is going to be a
less successful strategy in the next 10 years.</p>

        <p><a href="/author/jim-parinella/">Jim Parinella</a></p>
    
    <p>How do we make decisions? In many real-life examples we create a list of
choices and features, maybe take some data, rate how each option stacks up in
each feature, and coolly select the optimum choice. In ultimate you don&rsquo;t have
the time to go through this whole process. You have to rely on your trained
inner self to figure out what to do based on internalized guidelines.</p>
<p>Since I like lists of rules here are some for making sense of what is
happening on the field and figuring out what to do about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Take input from around you. Look, listen, and learn to identify what is important. Communicate â€” with eye contact, code words, or plain English if you need to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use your experience. A lot of field sense is really just knowing the tendencies of your teammates and opponents. Learn the signs that a defender has committed to a particular move so you can counteract. Become familiar with your offense&rsquo;s &ldquo;power positions&rdquo; from which a thrower can deliver an uncontested huck.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Know your preferences and strengths (hopefully they are the same). If you&rsquo;re fast enough, all you need is for your defender to lean the wrong way and you can go. Don&rsquo;t bother looking for the forehand huck if you can&rsquo;t hit it reliably.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Know your requirements. Be aware of where you are on the field and what your team needs from you at that point. Are others likely to be in good position to provide help or is there just one option?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have something to go to if all else fails. We all know to clear if we&rsquo;ve been shut down on a cut, but throwers should know what their final option is too â€” whether to punt it, look across the field for a long swing, or throw a leading pass to the closest dump. On defense, know what you can concede if you have to and what you absolutely cannot concede.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And here&rsquo;s how you go about getting better at it:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Engage in deliberate practice. 2 on 2 or 3 on 3 drills that focus on dump passes or first cuts or hucks can get you lots of reps in situations where all the unimportant inputs have been removed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compile an extensive experience bank. Quite frankly, you&rsquo;re going to have to make a lot of mistakes in order to get better. Play, and pay attention. Play summer league or rec tournaments, play goaltimate, play mini. While these can also lead to bad habits, they will give you lots of reps and put you in more situations where you have to make the play or you will lose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obtain feedback that is accurate, diagnostic, and timely. In practice ask your opponent why you got beat or why you couldn&rsquo;t get open.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review prior experiences. On the sideline between points or between games go over your play in your head. Think about not just your failures and obvious glories, but review the close calls. What could you have done better with that pass so the defender couldn&rsquo;t even have a bid on it? How could you have set up the defender better so that the thrower didn&rsquo;t have to make a perfect pass?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To learn, you need to think about what you will be doing and what you just
did, so that when it comes time to DO, you don&rsquo;t need to think.</p>

        <p><a href="/author/charlie-reznikoff/">Charlie Reznikoff</a></p>
    
    <p>Psychologist John Dewey debunked a commonly held belief called the stimulus-
response reflex arc: you see something, you decide what to do, you respond.
Instead, Dewey proposed, you only see what you have a mental framework for;
this framework contains your response within it. In other words, your response
exists before you see the stimulus. Many players have the experience of
knowing they&rsquo;ve thrown the goal before the disc leaves their hands, or
&ldquo;seeing&rdquo; the lay out D before it happens. Great players don&rsquo;t scan the field
for openings. That takes too long. Great players recognize the beginning of a
pattern that they can complete to their favor. Learning this pattern
recognition takes experience, a good system, and focused drilling. No doubt,
some players naturally learn quicker than others, and previous sports
experience helps. Usually, though, the quick learners are the ones at practice
working hard.</p>
<p>Sports Psychologist Alan Goldberg warns against asking players to think on the
field. A player should not &ldquo;see&rdquo; the field in that sense. In the huddle don&rsquo;t
ask your team to do anything other than rely on its training. Team leaders
should examine every drill, even (especially) the mindless warm up patterns.
Those drills teach your team the patterns it will later use to read the field.
If you want to throw to receivers cutting to space, don&rsquo;t run the &ldquo;straight on
attack&rdquo; drill. If you want to throw hucks from the middle of the field, don&rsquo;t
run the sideline huck drill. If you want to throw continuation swings after a
dump, include that in your reset drill. To better read poaches, try
scrimmaging 7(o) on 8(d) with the extra man poaching. Unless you&rsquo;ve drilled
it, your players won&rsquo;t see it. And if you&rsquo;ve drilled it wrong, they&rsquo;ll do it
wrong. Whatever your team is not &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; tells you, the team leader, where
you need to drill differently.</p>

    <p>I would argue that field vision, like speed or height, is pretty hard to teach
and learn. The best athletes don&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s happening so much as take a
picture of the field and respond. A few brains can do that kind of thing, but
most can&rsquo;t. Bill Rodriguez would counsel deeps in a zone to move up if they
saw seven opposing players in front of them. Super, if, like Bill, you can see
them all at once and count them at the same time. But of course something
comes with seeing patterns. A player who comes to Ultimate late, after playing
years of soccer, will probably have a better feel for the game than a cross-
country runner. One of the best first year players I ever saw had been a
quarterback. With no one trying to kill him every three seconds, ten seconds
seemed like plenty of time to survey and throw.</p>
<p>Three suggestions to getting better:</p>
<p><strong>1) Play a different position.</strong> Seems obvious, but do it. In that zone or on
offense, find a different spot. You will see the game differently and that
helps. Famously, Bill Russell ran every Celtics play from every position, not
just his own.</p>
<p><strong>2) Play some scrimmages with different parameters:</strong> A shorter or narrower
field, a shorter stall, six on seven.</p>
<p><strong>3) Find a way of trying things you know are never gonna work.</strong> &ldquo;After he
throws a swing I am going to stand in the lane and watch as I count &ldquo;one, two&rdquo;
and look around. Yeah, my guy may go score, but I am seeing what happens. If
your team allows for such scrimmages (and for more sensible versions of what I
am suggesting) you may be able to develop a better sense of &ldquo;go now&rdquo; or &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
wait,&rdquo; which is really all we are talking about.</p>

        <p><a href="/author/greg-husak/">Greg Husak</a></p>
    
    <p>Understanding positioning and distribution of players on the field is an
important skill, but also somewhat of an innate ability. How this skill
manifests itself is sometimes subtle and other times overt. It can show up in
the guy who always seems to be making the good cut to keep the offensive flow
going or in the physically ungifted player who consistently finds themselves
alone in the endzone. It can be the thrower who is able to find targets on the
goal line or the defender who gets a lot of poach blocks. It can be the
popper/wing in zone offense who is always touching the disc or the defensive
wing whose side the disc never advances on. All these traits come from someone
understanding the space around them and where the players on the field are
moving.</p>
<p>I was watching a Division I basketball practice once when a player made a
mistake and the coach, rather than ripping into him, asked the player what he
saw when he made that decision. By understanding the information that the
player was working with, he was better able to instruct the player. This
questioning is something that every player should endure, and at least ask
themselves, whenever a mistake is made. Did I recognize that poach in the
lane? Did I understand the balance of players on the field? Where was the open
space for me to cut to? Did I need to protect against my receiver going deep
when he was already 50 yards away from the disc? Of course, these questions
only deal with the perceived information, rather than what may have actually
happened, but it is a good starting place.</p>
<p>Developing field vision, or field sense, is a difficult thing, and requires
acute awareness of the other 13 players on the field, even while being
involved in the play. One thing that a thrower can do in a practice
environment is to throw the disc to the place where he sees the space, even if
there is nobody cutting there. By making this throw, it becomes obvious where
he is looking, and where he sees the space on the field. Cutters can also draw
attention by yelling at the thrower to alert him to where he should be
looking. Both these examples deal with one-to-one or one-to-few player
interactions. Developing this in a one-to-many or many-to-many fashion is more
difficult. There are some drills where a player turns to see a selection of
cutters, some which are marked, and others which are unmarked, and has to
recognize which players are open. This drill deals more with recognition of
cutters, rather than using space, but hopefully through this recognition, a
deeper level of identifying open cutters can be achieved. Another situation
may be where players close their eyes and then open them as the disc becomes
active; they have to quickly get a sense of the balance of players on the
field and where they should be moving, recognizing who should be cutting, or
what lanes need to be plugged before resuming the offensive/defensive plan.</p>

        <p><a href="/author/ryan-morgan/">Ryan Morgan</a></p>
    
    <p>I have a rather painful childhood memory from back in middle school. I was
playing basketball and went to set a low screen for another player. In a
moment of miscommunication both my defender and the player who I set a pick on
rushed to guard my teammate. I was left open for just a few seconds, but
before I realized it, the basketball hit me in the face. The point guard
recognized that I was about to be open and passed the ball early. I remember
appreciating two lessons learned from that moment. First, always keep your
head up so you don&rsquo;t get hit in the face unexpectedly. Second, and far more
importantly, if you keep your head up you can take advantage of narrow windows
of opportunity. This second lesson is field vision.</p>
<p>Like many Ultimate players, I can trace my field vision skills to non-Ultimate
sports like basketball and soccer. These taught me to move without the ball,
respond to a teammate&rsquo;s positioning and see open passing lanes. After lots of
practice one learns to pick up on tiny cues on the field from which one can
anticipate what will happen next. The hours of practice that give a basketball
player the field vision to use no-look passes are the same hours of practice
that give a handler the field vision to throw to a cutter that isn&rsquo;t open yet.
In both cases, field vision is a matter of picking up on and taking advantage
of tiny cues. In both cases, the only way to learn those cues is through hours
of practice.</p>
<p>Sure, some field vision skills from non-Ultimate sports translate to Ultimate.
A brand new Ultimate player with a soccer or lacrosse background will
generally have less trouble adjusting to the pace and movement of Ultimate
than a brand new player with only a golf background. But just like learning to
throw a flick, transferring field vision skills to Ultimate requires practice.
I remember my first few weeks playing Ultimate in college when, because of my
soccer background, standing in a tight stack in the middle of the field felt
so unnatural. I wanted to spread out like in soccer. As a rookie who couldn&rsquo;t
throw further than 15 feet, I was pegged as a cutter and continued to struggle
with the stack concept until one practice where we were randomly assigned
different roles. I got to be a handler, and though I still couldn&rsquo;t throw, I
could see where I wanted to throw. That&rsquo;s when the stack concept started to
make more sense to me. All it took was seeing the field from a different
perspective.</p>
<p>I think the way to teach field vision, if it can be taught, is to give players
the opportunity to see the field from a different perspective, or a different
angle, than they are used to. If the player is a cutter, make the player spend
some time handling. If the player is a defender, make the player spend some
time on the offensive team. If the player is a deep-deep in a zone defense,
make the player play in the cup. Seeing the field from different positions
helps you hone field vision because you learn the little cues that allow you
to anticipate what will happen next. All it takes is practice.</p>
