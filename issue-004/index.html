        <p>You're locked in on D against a downfield cutter when they plant and
head deep. Milliseconds later, the &quot;Up!&quot; call reaches your ears...the
deep ball is coming. What should you do? How do the best defenders
approach this crucial moment? How can you manufacture a D, and help your
team win?Â </p>
<p>This issue of &quot;The Huddle&quot; focuses on these defensive questions. The
breadth of possible approaches underlies the differences in strategies
between players and teams and, we hope, will be useful for many
different kinds of players at all levels. Enjoy!Â </p>

    <p>It seems sensible to find the disc as early as possible. However, I think
first I need to make sure I&rsquo;m matching the receiver stride for stride, so I
let them do the work of finding the disc early on and use that time to make up
some ground.</p>
<p>Any work they do finding the disc will also help me pinpoint where to look for
it. Once I&rsquo;m matching their stride, I&rsquo;ll look for the disc and start making
judgments about how the contest is going to pan out</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a leading pass, I just need to put my head down and try to get between
the receiver and the disc, as close to the receiver as possible, and
preferably with a decent jump. If I can establish a better line than them,
I&rsquo;ll try to do that. Realistically, my high layouts are pretty ineffectual and
injury-creating, but I&rsquo;ve seen some great high blocks from layouts, so go for
it if it&rsquo;s your thing.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a floating pass, I would usually approach the bid from behind the
receiver. If the receiver needs to back up, I probably try to establish
position early to stop them backing up (but beware other receivers coming in
for scraps!). If the receiver has good position, I try to stay out and get in
a well-timed maximal jump at speed while they&rsquo;re standing flat-footed under
the disc. If the cut is from the break side, it generally means there&rsquo;s a bit
more room for negotiating position, so it pays to find the disc early and
establish the best line at the disc.</p>
<p>If they have a height advantage, I&rsquo;ll try to establish position early and stop
them getting a play on the disc. If I have a height advantage, I&rsquo;ll try to
just find the place where I can bid for it at close to maximum jump and bid
for it there, assuming they can&rsquo;t bid in the same place. But I want to
minimise the risk of it going over my head and giving them a cheap win, so I
include a bit of a margin of error in choosing that spot. So it helps to know
if someone is short with big hops.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a leading pass and they have a speed advantage, as they spike it in my
face I probably turn around and start abusing the marker for letting out a
clean huck.</p>

        <p><a href="/author/ben-wiggins/">Ben Wiggins</a></p>
    
    <p>Deep D is a lot like poker in three significant ways:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Information is more important than anything else.<br>
<strong>2.</strong> You play the hand you are dealt, and try to win more than your share
given the cards in your hand.<br>
<strong>3.</strong> It ain&rsquo;t over until til it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p><strong><em>Information:</em></strong> As I turn to head deep and hear that &ldquo;up&rdquo; call, I need to
get a read on the disc as quickly as possible. I definitely take a look, even
if it loses me a small bit of speed. Personally, if that throw is a footrace,
then I am likely to lose anyway&hellip;especially if they have a step or two on me.
Then again, if every throw was perfectly out in front, then it would be like
playing 1-card draw; you win or lose based on your raw speed everytime. And I
got dealt a 3 of diamonds a long time ago. But throws aren&rsquo;t reliable or
consistent, and there are lots of other ways to win. If I can make a quicker
read than my opponent, I can win many of the discs that are too short (since I
turn on them quicker if I recognize it early) and I have a better chance at
discs that are turned in the win (where recognizing spin and speed can help me
to pin the other player and use the win to take it away from both of us). I
need that information as soon as I can.</p>
<p>Reading the disc is surprisingly accurate, even in a short amount of time.
With a glance, I feel like I can pretty safely put my head down and run to a
good spot. At U of Oregon, we used to play a game where we would huck the disc
into the air, then close our eyes and run to a spot after watching for the
first half-second. We did the same thing for shorter throws indoors&hellip;with no
wind, you can catch 2-3 out of 10 20-yard throws with your eyes closed, if you
can read it for the first 3 feet of the flight. Getting the right early read
is something you can practice.</p>
<p>Additionally, if the &ldquo;up&rdquo; call was wrong or if the disc is partially blocked
then I can react more quickly if I see it first.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Hand You Are Dealt:</em></strong> Once I see the disc in the air, I have a good
idea of how likely it is that I should win.</p>
<p>If it is a smaller, slower player and I have a good chance of catching up to a
hanging throw, then I should be able to make the play. I&rsquo;m more likely to try
for a catch-block, more conscious of preventing a foul by keeping clear, and
more likely to wait to go so that I don&rsquo;t give up an easy catch by misreading.</p>
<p>The better athlete that I am against, or the worse the throw/position
situation&hellip;the more likely that I am going to want to bid early or try to win
by position. I can take some risks, or make a read on the disc based on what
it might do. For example, if the disc is coming in with some wind, and I think
that there is a 1/5 chance that it might hang for longer&hellip;I might try to pin
the other player so that I win those 20% of discs IF I think they are likely
to beat me more than 80% of the time if I make a normal play. Occassionally,
this leads to what seems like a very poor read, and a good athlete makes an
easy catch. Even flat-footed. I get posterized sometimes. Losing and looking
bad, to me, is no different from losing and giving a handsome, respectable
effort. But occassionally I will get a block against someone I have no
business blocking, by playing against those odds.</p>
<p>An aside&hellip;my horror situation: Getting an awesome read and position against a
much better athlete. Not that this is a terribly situation, numbers-wise (I
just hate having the other player own control of the outcome). At Nationals in
2004, I made the break of my life to a disc in the corner while guarding
Bailey Russell (Pike). I went up with a good read and tried to stay wide in
the shoulders to keep him away. It felt like a sure block, until he jumped
fully around me the wrong way to come down with a goal. He made it look easy,
and made me look silly.</p>
<p>The scariest second of my life was poaching onto a huck in the semis in 2007
and knowing that, somewhere, Damien was behind me and coming as his top speed
(with the understanding that his &lsquo;slow&rsquo; is faster than my &lsquo;fast&rsquo;). As I went
up, I had absolutely no clue whether or not this was going to be Bailey all
over again. Luckily, I stuck to my read and, as it happens, Damien is about 14
yards faster than me on a 40 yard sprint&hellip;but he isn&rsquo;t 15 yards faster. This
is my version of a huge bluff, when the other player has the ability to call
or fold; your life is in their hands.</p>
<p><strong><em>It Ain&rsquo;t Over &lsquo;Til It&rsquo;s Over:</em></strong> Play the thing out. You never know when a
great athlete is going to bobble the disc, and your hustle might put you in
position to knock it away. Catch every block you can (how many times have you
ever tried to catch a block, and had it MAC up and get caught? Now, how many
times have you had this happen when you swiped at it? The math comes out huge
on the side of the catch-block attempt). If you jump, and miss, try to land
ready to jump again. They might have missed as well, and it might be the
second jump that gets you there. Just because you have the best hand, you
don&rsquo;t start grinning and throwing chips at the pile&hellip;do the work. You may
have the worst possible hand, but don&rsquo;t go out unless you are forced to pay to
keep going. You never know which hand you might win.</p>

    <p>As I am already behind, my priority is to catch up. It&rsquo;s harder to run fast
with your head turned, so I will sometimes let the intended receiver read the
disc for me and take the hit, in terms of speed. At this point, help from the
sideline, in terms of which direction to go, is very helpful.</p>
<p>As soon as I know that I can catch up, or I hear from the sideline that the
throw is short, I will turn my head. If I turn my head and am close to the
offensive player, I will also raise my off arm (head turned right means left
arm is up) about chest level with my forearm bent and parallel with the
ground. This arm is especially important with floaty discs, but is not used
with any significant force. It is more of a warning system to prevent tangled
legs or knocked heads, which is easy when there are two people not looking
where they are going.</p>
<p>All thing being equal, I will work to get between the path the disc will take
to the receiver. I only have to get a tip of a finger to get a block, but they
need a whole hand, which means I can make a more aggressive bid. Making a
defensive bid from the backside can be dangerous, and rarely results in a
clean block. Taking a position behind the receiver relative to the path of the
disc should be reserved for gross misreads by the receiver.</p>
<p>As the disc makes its final approach, I focus on making an aggressive bid.
This means coordinating my movements so that when the time comes to jump or
layout, I am ready to do so. This means chopping my steps to take off on the
correct foot (if there is time to do so), and driving my arms (like a high-
jumper).</p>

    <p>When I hear the &ldquo;up&rdquo; call I try to spot the disc, briefly and without giving
up any more ground.</p>
<p>I need to ascertain if it has truly gone up, and if it is intended for the
player I am now chasing. If both of these things are true, then I try to make
some quick calculations based on what type of throw has been made.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If it is low or short, I can simply go to it and have position underneath.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is high, I need to catch up and try to establish a good position to jump at it. Ideally, it is a position where the player I am defending can&rsquo;t get a running leap at the disc, or a position where the player I am defending has to foul me to make a play.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the throw is long, I have to assess if I can make up the ground, to establish the position I just described, or try and sell my angle as to draw the player I am defending off his line, or now to defend me. (This could also be a strategy for high throws).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, as I am running through this situation I am aware, or try to be, of
where any help could be coming from. Likely: nowhere, since we were in the
back of the stack. However, if my player&rsquo;s in cut was &ldquo;in&rdquo; enough, I will have
some support deep.</p>
<p>I think you have a better chance to make the play or have them miss it if they
are less athletic. If they are more athletic, I would probably force more
under and try to block the away cut. I don&rsquo;t think the force matters too much,
except where you might look as the &ldquo;up&rdquo; call happens as it will limit the some
throwers options.</p>

        <p><a href="/author/greg-husak/">Greg Husak</a></p>
    
    <p>There is a big factor that comes into play here that I should use to set the
stage:</p>
<p><em>Why are big time football receivers 6'2&quot; or 6'3&quot; and 220lbs (think Terrell
Owens), while big time defensive backs are 5'10&quot; or 5'11&quot; and 190lbs?</em></p>
<p>And: <em>Why does it generally seem that DBs are the fastest guys, but you
routinely see them getting beat deep by receivers who should be slower?</em></p>
<p>There are two speeds that ultimate defenders (and football defenders) have.
The first is the sprint where your man may change directions, and the second
is the sprint where you&rsquo;re going for the disc and can just go all out. Against
many receivers the former is all you need, but at the elite levels you have to
have the latter, and you have to be able to use it wisely. If you can stay in
the ballpark with your &ldquo;change direction&rdquo; sprint then you&rsquo;ve got some big
challenges ahead of you. Try getting into an all-out sprint and have your man
change direction and you&rsquo;re going to be hosed because your form is not
prepared to make this change and you&rsquo;ll spend an extra few steps changing your
vector. Receivers have the luxury of being able to be in that full sprint mode
whenever they want because they know when they have to change direction and
can subtly alter their form to make those changes. Defenders have to
constantly be ready for the receiver to change direction.</p>
<p>As soon as I hear that &ldquo;up&rdquo; call, I try getting into the all-out sprint mode.
As I&rsquo;m doing that, and maybe even more importantly, I take a quick look back
to see if I can get a glimpse of the disc. This quick look can give you a lot
of information: what shoulder is the disc going to, is it a missile or a
floater and is it flat or hooking? With this information in mind, I&rsquo;ll then
try to close the gap, hopefully getting on the receiver&rsquo;s shoulder on the side
I think the disc is coming to.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;ve got a bigger gap to close I might listen for a shoulder from the
sideline, or try to take cues from the receiver to get some of the information
the look back would have helped with. If I see the receiver really start
striding I know it&rsquo;s going to be long and I&rsquo;ve got to close and get by him to
have a chance. If I see him sit up I can guess it&rsquo;s going to be a floater and
I&rsquo;ll have time to get there and should be ready to jump. I can also figure out
which shoulder by seeing how he looks back.</p>
<p>In the last few steps I start assessing the situation: where is the disc
coming down, where can I take it earliest, where is the receiver? The goal is
to take it as early as possible while not giving a bailout foul. If he&rsquo;s
misread it, I may have a little leeway in where I can take it down or how to
position myself to prevent him from making a play.</p>
<p>The athleticism of the opponent plays less of a role than one might think (for
me at least). The first thing is to figure out where I can take the disc as
early as possible. I&rsquo;ll generally assume that my opponent will have similar
athleticism, so if I take it at my highest he should be looking to take it at
a similar spot. But if I can get there at the same time or a bit earlier I&rsquo;ll
be fine. If he&rsquo;s got position or can get it sooner than me, then I might have
to change my bid to try to take him out of his comfort zone and hope for the
best, assuming that my normal bid would be worthless.</p>

    <p>Even though the answer to this question is pretty straightforwardâ€”a surprising
number of club players make errors on this play.</p>
<p>First of all, if I am only a stride or two behind my check when a huck goes up
then I am feeling pretty good about my positioning. Only a perfectly thrown
disc will not allow me to have a play on it. Secondlyâ€”and this is where many
players make an errorâ€”I always make the inside play on the disc. No matter
your height or the height of your opponent, it is always more difficult for
someone to jump over you to make a catch. On occasion, when I am boxed out and
lose the battle for position, I am invariably caught getting a close up view
of a sweaty butt in my face as my check catches the disc uncontested.</p>
<p>At the elite levels, positioning is everything. Get in front. You may need to
push and battle for this positioning. If your opponent is way taller than you
and the disc is too high for you to touch, jump early and try to get them to
go up early too. If your opponent is only an inch or two taller than you (or
shorter) then go for the disc at your max. If you are in front and have
position, your jump should be plenty to make the play.</p>
<p>Whatever you do&hellip;don&rsquo;t &ldquo;snuggle&rdquo; in behind. That is just bad ultimate.</p>

    <p>Being a receiver, this scenario is one of my favorite moments in ultimate. The
adrenaline kicks in and it dawns on you that it&rsquo;s your turn to make the play
you have been training all season. My training regimen is focused on
maximizing acceleration and jumping ability, both of which are essential to
getting the block in this scenario. But before putting those skills to use,
you have to look up quickly and find the disc. In this brief glance you must
do three things:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Confirm that the throw is, in fact, to your man.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Check to see if the disc is under-thrown.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Identify if the throw is forehand or backhandâ€”this will tell you which
of your shoulders the disc will come over as well as the spin on the disc. All
this information has to be ascertained instantly.</p>
<p>The next step, and I really don&rsquo;t think the importance of this can be
understated, is to get position on the other player. Unless you are a giant or
have a 45&quot; vertical, an advantageous position relative to the other player is
the single best thing you can do to get the block.</p>
<p>When I first started playing club ultimate, I was fortunate enough to play
with Kevin Kusy on a successful Mixed team called BRU. Kusy is a great
receiver who won a college championship with the 1999 NC State team. He was a
bit bigger, a bit taller, and much more experienced than I was but we went up
against each other all the time in practice. At first he absolutely tooled me
on these types of plays. After a while I learned that getting position on him
was more important than reading the disc perfectly and attempting to catch it
at the height of my jump. Eventually, I started bringing down some discs
against him by first establishing position.</p>
<p>I learned that the first step in getting position is to get ahead of the other
player as soon as possible. This is where the acceleration comes in. If you
can beat the player downfield you can have first choice of position and that
is hugely important. Additionally, once in front, you can dictate where the
other player goes or does not go. You can steer him or her away from where you
can make a play on the disc (within the scope of the rules, of course). If
required, this is where the jumping ability comes in.</p>
<p>Assuming I have position, as the disc is approaching I am thinking about how
to make the play while keeping the other player &ldquo;locked up,&rdquo; usually on my
shoulder. For example, if it&rsquo;s a flick huck down the sideline, I would take a
line on the disc that pushed the other player towards the middle of the field
(again, obviously, within the scope of the rules). As the disc approached, I
would adjust my speed to his in order to keep him locked up on my left
shoulder so he couldn&rsquo;t get around me to make a play. My last two steps would
be strong towards the disc to make the block with an outstretched right arm.</p>
<p>A ending tangent on acceptable levels of contact in receiving situations: I
think that the undeniable increase in contact that goes uncalled in these
situations at the elite level is due to the mutual respect players have for
one another. It comes from a mutual desire to play as hard as possible and to
leave everything on the field. Additionally it takes a mutual understanding
that playing at that level necessarily requires a certain amount of contact
that the rules, under some interpretations, may not allow. Oftentimes at the
elite level, players chose to interpret the rules in a way that allows almost
any receiving contact that does not truly affect the outcome of the play. In
an extreme example, Kevin Kusy was playing with Ring of Fire in the semifinals
of Club Nationals in 2003 against Furious George. A throw went up to his man,
Andrew Lugsdin, in the endzone. Both players charged hard toward the disc and
made so much contact that Kusy broke his clavicle on the play. Lugsdin caught
the goal and no foul was called.</p>
<p>I understand that this may seem unnecessarily dangerous to some. But I find it
extremely satisfying to be able to battle with an opponent and take some hits
knowing that I can hit right back without fearing a foul call. One of my
favorite players to play against is Taylor Pope of Ring of Fire. When he
guards me its always very physical. But the physical contact between us is
never intended to gain an unfair advantage (e.g. tugging at shirts,
intentional hacking on the mark, pushing, tripping). We both thrive on the
challenge that physical play presents, but we also both understand where to
draw the line. As such, I have a huge amount of respect for him. I suspect it
is this combination of a mutual desire to play as hard as possible and a
mutual respect for other players, that accounts for the level of acceptable
contact at the elite level.</p>

    <p>In the deep-D scenario, the disc is already in the air. But let&rsquo;s rewind just
a bit. As a defender, my goal is for the &ldquo;up&rdquo; call to be the second sign that
the disc is coming. The first sign should be my anticipation of the play as it
develops. The more I am aware of what is happening with the disc, the mark,
and the other cutters, the easier it is to anticipate. As my man cuts on the
field, I want to see the possible throws before they happen. Most of the
throws I see will never go up, but when one does go up, I&rsquo;m already on it.</p>
<p>Have you ever sat a stoplight and watched the light for the other direction
turn from green to yellow to red? When your light finally turns green, it&rsquo;s
just a confirmation of what you already knew was about to happen. How much
quicker are you off that line if you&rsquo;re peeking at the other light versus
waiting for yours to change? That&rsquo;s the difference between reacting and
anticipating on D. When I hear that &ldquo;up&rdquo; call, I want to already know what
throw is coming and already be poised to jump on it.</p>
<p>Once I hear that &ldquo;up&rdquo; call, my first action is to explode with three or four
hard steps toward the cutter. I need to accelerate and start closing that gap
between him and me. Especially if we&rsquo;re similar in speed, every step counts.
I&rsquo;ve got to get there in order to make the play.</p>
<p>Next, I take a quick look at the disc. Ideally, I&rsquo;ve anticipated the throw
that&rsquo;s coming, and I know about where to look. The quick peek gives me a
general read on the disc, usually falling into one of three categories: 1. too
low or too short, and I&rsquo;m going to pick it off easily; 2. long and cruisy, and
it&rsquo;s going to be a straight-up footrace; 3. something in between that will
demand a good read on the disc and good positioning for the D.</p>
<p>Now, I can adjust based on the my quick read of the disc. If the disc is
short, I&rsquo;ve found out soon enough to grab it before my man can cut back in. If
the disc is long, I&rsquo;m going to make like it&rsquo;s track practice and blow by him.
If it&rsquo;s in between, as most throws tend to be, it gets more complicated.</p>
<p>My goal on a disc that&rsquo;s hanging is to get myself right next to the cutter as
quickly as possible. On D, I don&rsquo;t want to read the disc and drift toward it,
because I&rsquo;m playing defense on the cutter, not the disc. Even if I don&rsquo;t have
a perfect read, if I&rsquo;m next to my man I&rsquo;ll be in position to make a play.</p>
<p>Everyone loves the vertical game in ultimate, but most hanging discs are won
and lost in the positioning more than the jump. I know that if I get myself in
the right place, I&rsquo;ll probably get the block Most cutters will read and drift
toward the disc, and so want to keep off their back hip and away from where
the disc is heading. If we&rsquo;re running deep for an open-side forehand huck, the
cutter wants to keep me off his right hip and catch with his left hand. The
best way for me to get the block is to run past the cutter so I can take
position right where he doesn&rsquo;t want me to be. Suddenly, it&rsquo;s a whole lot
harder for him to read the disc, position himself to make the catch, and box
me out all at the same time.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m catching up to the cutter, I look back for a second read on the disc in
order to decide whether to run past his front side or back side. If the throw
is fairly straight, I like to run by the front side (the side closest to the
throw) because it&rsquo;s harder for the cutter to adjust and box me out. If the
throw is tipping to the left (outside-in) and/or there&rsquo;s wind pushing it that
way, it&rsquo;s generally best to run by the back side, putting myself right between
the cutter and where he needs to go to make the catch. Whichever side I
choose, I want to make sure I am at least even and probably a half step past
the cutter.</p>
<p>As the disc comes in and I&rsquo;m getting ready to go up, I want to stay close to
the cutter. If we both miss it, it&rsquo;s my disc. Once I take up position on the
front side, I&rsquo;m reading the cutter as much as the disc; I want to drift back
with him so that if the disc jumps over me, it&rsquo;s over him too. Once I take up
position on the backside, I want to hold my ground so he can&rsquo;t drift back and
get under the disc.</p>
<p>At the right moment, I go up and grab it. Often, good positioning makes this
easy. Sometimes, depending on the cutter and the situation, it doesn&rsquo;t. But
going for the catch is almost always the best play. First, I avoid tipping the
disc to the cutter or another opponent following the play; losing a sweet D to
the trash pick-up is more than dissappointing. Second, if it&rsquo;s close, I&rsquo;m more
likely to make a fair, clean play on the disc, as opposed to if I&rsquo;m chopping
away at it. Third, if there&rsquo;s some contact between players, especially
incidental arm contact, it&rsquo;s a lot harder to justify a foul call when I come
down with the disc.</p>
<p>Fourth, the fast break is on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my deep D. To recap:</p>
<p><strong>0.</strong> Always peek at the light.<br>
<strong>1.</strong> Sprint first.<br>
<strong>2.</strong> Quick read.<br>
<strong>3.</strong> Get close.<br>
<strong>4.</strong> Run by.<br>
<strong>5.</strong> Stay close.<br>
<strong>6.</strong> Catch it.</p>

    <p>When I hear the up-call, my first instinct is to get between my player and
where I think the disc is going to be. I don&rsquo;t look for the disc yet because
the disc is secondary to my player when I&rsquo;m on defense. If I can get my body
into the proper position, I will get the disc every time.</p>
<p>Typically in this situation, I will try to make some kind of body contact (not
with arms or legs)â€”jockeying for position using my butt or shoulders to
maintain my position between my player and the disc. This is something that
changes from game to game in what will be called a foul and what will not. I
appreciate games in which some contact is allowed so that contact similar to
what is usually used in soccer for shielding the ball is appropriate.</p>
<p>Information that is important to me when trying to establish my position
includes: type of throw (forehand vs. backhand, inside-out vs. outside-in),
handedness of the thrower, power of throw, float of throw, and wind. All of
these things will affect the flight pattern of the throw and thus where you
should position yourself. You should know some of these things immediatelyâ€”if
the throw is on the live side, you know it is a forehand if you are forcing
forehand. The one hitch to this is if the thrower is left-handed. To be a
great defender, you need to check in with who has the disc at all times so
that you know whether a forehand or lefty backhand will be coming up. You
should always have the force of the wind noted in your mind at all times
during a game so that you don&rsquo;t have to lick your finger and test it while
trying to get a D. The power, flight path (IO vs. OI), and float of the throw
are all things you should be able to read by the first time you see the disc
in the air.</p>
<p>After hearing an up call, I typically take 3-4 hard sprint steps to catch up
to my person before I check in with the disc. Then, when I do check in with
the disc, it is a brief look during which I can see how high it is, how fast
it is going and at what angle it is flying. The person I&rsquo;m guarding doesn&rsquo;t
come into my mind that much as I try to establish position.</p>
<p>If you have all the correct information and have the right body positioning
based on this information, you will be able to get the D every time. You don&rsquo;t
have to worry about jumping higher than someone unless they are significantly
more athletic or taller than you. If this is the case you might want to jump
earlier to get more of your body between them and the disc (and they will also
probably going early). If I am similarly athletic to my offensive player and
in proper position, I will go for the catch with both hands to make sure I get
the D. However, if I haven&rsquo;t had time to get in the right position, I will go
with one hand over or through the hands of my player to reduce the risk of
fouling. If the huck goes up to the break side, I spend more time sprinting to
get position and reading my player than I spend reading the disc itself
because as the saying goes on defense, &ldquo;Play the player, not the disc.&rdquo; As
long as they don&rsquo;t catch it, you did your job.</p>

    <h4><a href="https://the-huddle.indiaultimate.org/issue-004/train-for-the-launch-pad/" itemprop="headline">Train For The Launch Pad</a></h4>

    <p>More than any other skill in ultimateâ€”besides, maybe, getting layout
blocksâ€”dominating in the air has largely to do with raw athleticism,
aggressiveness, and instinct. There&rsquo;s really no substitute for being a
physical beast. If you&rsquo;re tall and fast, and you have springs for legs, you&rsquo;re
going to posterize some poor souls, and in the process you&rsquo;ll develop
confidence and intuition that you&rsquo;ll bring into every future matchup.</p>
<p>So: train. Even if you&rsquo;re not a premium genetic specimen, effective training
can bring out the inner beast. You can add a few inches to your vertical and
shave a couple tenths off your 40; perhaps more importantly, preparation gives
you confidence. I find that if I haven&rsquo;t trained very well, then when a disc
goes up, I notice doubts creeping into my mind. I second-guess how high I can
jump; I wonder if my guy is faster or stronger than I am; I worry about being
skied. But if I&rsquo;m confident in my training and preparation, then when the long
throw goes up, my first thought is, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s mine!&rdquo; And that&rsquo;s pretty much the
only thought in my head until the disc is (or isn&rsquo;t) in my hand.</p>
<p>If you are going to be thinking while the disc is in the air, then one useful
thing to concentrate on is your &ldquo;launch pad&rdquo;â€”the place you ideally want to be
jumping from. The one-on-one contest for a long throw is actually two
contests: the first is a race for position, the second a test of who can leap
higher. To win the race for position, get your body between your opponent and
the launch pad as quickly as possible. Then, ideally, you&rsquo;ll decelerate as you
approach the launch pad, while using your body to box out/maintain position
until the jump. (You want to put yourself into position to decelerate because
you jump highest when you&rsquo;re neither sprinting all-out nor standing still). If
you can win this contest for position, then it doesn&rsquo;t matter as much who can
jump higher.</p>
<p>There are two good ways to prepare for this battle of positioning. First, when
you&rsquo;re practicing long throws with a friend, try to catch each high pass at
the highest point possible. This will help give you confidence in your own
assessment of your leaping ability. In other words, you will practice figuring
out where your launch pad is. (A common error in deep receiving/defending is
that a player focuses on where and when the opponent is jumping, rather than
the optimum point for his/her jump). Second, when you&rsquo;re playing games of
&ldquo;500&rdquo; with a couple of friends of similar height, try playing with &ldquo;no jumping
allowed&rdquo; rules. This will force you to focus on out-positioning, rather than
simply out-jumping, your opponent.</p>

    <p>If your man starts heading deep and you hear an up-call, you have to assume
the thrower is putting up a huck&hellip;so, obviously, you&rsquo;ve got to try to beat
your guy to the spot.</p>
<p>Back to Ultimate 101 for a second: if you were guarding the last guy in the
stack, you probably have last-back responsibilities. An unguarded deep look is
a lot more dangerous than an open under cut, so make sure the deep is shut
down first. That means if you haven&rsquo;t communicated to your next deepest
defender that you are going to follow your man in, you&rsquo;ve got to remain the
deepest player on the field, and not get sucked underneath.</p>
<p>Now from the point where you&rsquo;re one on one with your guy as he goes out&hellip;when
you hear the up-call, I would not turn to find the frisbee at first. More than
likely, your guy is going to take you in the direction you need to goâ€”it&rsquo;s
most important to stay with him until you have the chance to find the frisbee
without losing a step. Therefore, accelerate with your man, and once you get
up to speed, then turn your head to find the disc. Since you just followed
this guy underneath (and were facing the handlers), you should have a pretty
good idea where the throw is coming fromâ€”at the least, you know which side of
the field the disc is coming from. This information will let you know which
shoulder to look over (if it&rsquo;s not obvious).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to make as quick an assessment of where the disc is going as
possibleâ€”you don&rsquo;t want to be running downfield looking backwards (I don&rsquo;t
know much about proper sprinting form, but something tells me this isn&rsquo;t going
to get you moving as fast as possible). Take a peek, then get your head back
around and sprintâ€”look back again only periodically. Each time you locate the
disc, be working to out-position your opponent. Whoever takes the straightest
line to where the disc ends up has the best chance of making the play.</p>
<p>In the event that you&rsquo;re guarding a more athletic player, you are most likely
going to want to force that person underneath. That means when he cuts in, you
follow him in with the intent of staying close, but not to try to actually get
in front and get a block. Your first priority is preventing this player from
beating you deepâ€”again, giving up a 10-yard gainer underneath is better than a
huck over the top. So since you&rsquo;re following him in, when he stops and turns
to go out, you&rsquo;re now a step ahead of him. Use your body! Do not be afraid of
contact hereâ€”make him run through you to get deep. As he turns around he&rsquo;s
going to have to get around you, so block his path. If he tries to get around
your right side, step right. If he goes left, move left. Move your feet and be
ready to turn your hips to run downfield. Get in his way to stop his momentum,
then (or at the same time) turn and accelerate!</p>
