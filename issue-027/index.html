          Fielding The Pull

        <p>In any offense, starting off organized and with a plan is essential to
moving down the field effectively and quickly. In this issue we take a
look at the very first seconds after the defense has pulled and the disc
is high into air. How do you field the pull? How many handlers to do you
hold back? What considerations do you make based on how deep the pull
goes, or which side of the field it lands on?</p>
<p>Our roster of authors explores everything that goes into efficiently
receiving the disc and moving upfield, and they also share tips to
eliminate common and correctable errors.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>

    <p>As others have mentioned, it&rsquo;s highly important to catch the pull whenever
possible. In the Women&rsquo;s game, far too many players let the pull hit the
ground if it comes in at a hard angle. As a puller, I&rsquo;ve learned to take
advantage of this by working on big outside-in pulls to gain an extra second
or two while the player stops a roll and picks up the disc, possibly gain
field position if the player misreads how the disc will roll, and give the
offense a wet disc to work with if there&rsquo;s dew on the grass. All of that is
negated if the offense simply catches the pull.</p>
<p>When running a horizontal stack offense, teams I&rsquo;ve played on will call three
handlers and designate one as the person to receive the first pass in the
center of the field. Either of the other two handlers will field the pull,
depending on which side of the field the pull heads towards. The two side
handlers need to communicate as soon as they get a read on the pull who will
catch it. If I&rsquo;m one of these side handlers catching the pull, I like to count
down my catch &ldquo;3&hellip;2&hellip;1&rdquo; so that other players on the field know exactly when
our offense gains possession and is off to the races. The handler who gets the
disc centered to her should read how fast the defense is coming down and
position herself such that she can gain as many easy, uncontested yards as
possible with the first pass.</p>

    <p><em>Preface:</em> Ever since I started playing competitive Ultimate, I have been on
the D team. So, receiving the pull isn&rsquo;t something that I have partaken in
very often. That being said, I have done it and can give a viewpoint from a
defensive standpoint.</p>
<p>Most important and crucial part of receiving the pull is the reception. I mean
pure and simple, having someone there to initially catch the disc. From an
offensive standpoint, catching the pull is where the offense begins. This is
analogous to the inbounds pass in basketball; if you can&rsquo;t confidently,
successfully inbound the ball, you are going to have some unnecessary
turnovers. The offense wants to catch the disc and get it moving right away
whether for a set play, or string, or just to gain easy ground before the
defense sets up. Whether due to miscommunication or a lack of confidence in
catching, a pull hitting soil is starting off on the wrong foot for an
offensive team.</p>
<p>In terms of how many should be back for this procedure and where they are
positioned is determined by what offensive structure your team uses. For a
horizontal, I would typically have one back to receive the disc and then two
secondary handler options which form a triangle from the initial reception.
Behind this, downfield, would be the normal horizontal stack. Procedurally, I
would have an outside handler receive the pull, hit one of the two upfield
options, and fill in to the outside of the person they had just thrown to
(figure provided). The main purpose of this is get the disc to the center of
the field to help open up space. This also gives the handlers, and offense, a
routine to follow. Psychologically, this is a good way to forget what has
happened in the game up till now and get refocused on the current point; watch
any professional tennis player before he/she serves and notice that they
bounce the ball the same number of times before each serve, or watch a
basketball player before a free throw.</p>
<p>For a vertical stack, I would maintain have one handler back to receive the
pull and a handler upfield, in the middle, as a first option. From here, you
can either fall into the offense, or follow the string called.</p>
<p>Lastly, I remember a quote from my previous captain, Jonathan Potts, that is
meaningful in this circumstance.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;A good puller is worth 2-3 breaks a game.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>If your offensive team can work out a system to make this statement irrelevant
to your team, then I would say you know how to receive the pull.</p>

    <p>First of all, I would be very intrigued to hear the Open authors&rsquo; answers on
this question because, for the most part, Women&rsquo;s pulls do not involve a
ridiculous amount of rocket science to field (or maybe I have been missing out
on something for years).</p>
<p>Typically, we will call a pull play where one person on the left side of the
field fields the pull if it goes left and one person on the right side of the
field fields the pull if it goes right. Therefore, within a second or two
after the puller releases the disc, the appropriate player calls out that they
will field the pull and feed it into a player that is in the center.</p>
<p>If at all possible, it is pretty advantageous to catch the pull. When it is
windy â€” especially in Women&rsquo;s Ultimate â€” it may even be necessary to
<strong>sprint</strong> forward once the pull is thrown to try and catch it before it hits
the ground. That also means that your whole offensive line needs to be
sprinting forward as well. Also, it is smart to practice fielding rollers and
stopping rollers from obviously advancing in a direction to your disadvantage
â€” whether that be to the trap sideline or back towards your endzone.</p>

    <p>The best offensive teams can get big yards from the first few passes off a
pull, and immediately knock the defense on its heels. There are no shortage of
ways to do this, and the best offenses I have been a part of have always had a
few options for taking this advantage.</p>
<p>In all cases the critical first component is having a player who feels
comfortable catching the pull and throwing the first pass. This person should
feel confident catching passes while backing up, getting in front of rollers,
and in general putting themselves in that position where they may make the
mistake, and might not get noticed for doing their job correctly. So often I
see the catcher shy away from a difficult catch, let the disc hit the ground,
then gather it and throw the first pass. This second or two that is lost is a
tremendous advantage to the defense.</p>
<p>Some teams I have been on have a variety of plays to attack the sidelines or
the middle of the field, and can work on isolations, or on group movement to
create an advantage for the offense. In most cases these are very simple
plays, and so really only require a bit of practice time to get familiar with,
and a few scrimmages to get comfortable executing. Other teams have been very
simple, with just one pull play and then an option in case that play doesn&rsquo;t
go off. Sometimes this simplicity is very helpful, but the simplicity also
requires all the players to be aware of what is developing so they can execute
the backup plan together. At any rate, there are a variety of options
available to a team, and even a novice captain should be able to draw up one
or two simple ones for his team, with a simple flood one side and execute a
string of passes to set players being the most universal/basic.</p>
<p>I think the only adjustment that needs to be made in response to wind would be
to designate the side of the field that the play will be run to before the
pull comes. By specifying the side of the field you can put your offense in
the position where they have an easier reset, or where the deep throw is most
favorable for the wind. In general, however, responding to the pull as it
comes will be dynamic enough to keep the defense on their heels and give the
offense the best possible chance to score by giving a well-designed play the
most space to work with.</p>

        <p><a href="/author/adam-goff/">Adam Goff</a></p>
    
    <p>The key goal when receiving the pull is to get into your play/offense as
quickly and safely as possible. A few thoughts on how to do this:</p>
<p>Unless the pull is going out of bounds or a big blade in a nice wind, <strong>catch
it</strong> and get it moving. If it&rsquo;s a big blade, stop it as soon as it hits and do
the same thing. The only situation which I can think of in which you would not
want to do this is if the pull is going to hit and slide out of bounds AND the
defense is already set up on all the people you might throw to. That&rsquo;s pretty
rare, so get it going.</p>
<p>If you are trying to get the disc to the center of the field (common in a
horizontal offense), then it is a good idea to have that thrower start near
the middle of your line on the pull, and the other two handlers lined up near
the outsides. That way either one of them can receive the pull. As soon as it
is determined who will receive the pull, the other handler must get into
position so you <strong>have options</strong>. The defense, especially if they know your
team, will work hard to stop your first option. You need the second option,
and sometimes a third option. Just having this first pass option is not enough
â€” you need to have an ability to run the play or your offense off of this.</p>
<p>One special option: We used to call this &ldquo;X&rdquo; and it would be called after the
pull. If the pull was deep, and especially if it was windy and we were going
upwind, the â€˜option handler&rsquo; could call &ldquo;X.&rdquo; This means that the option
handler would receive the first pass and then pass it to the person who was
supposed to receive that pass. This let us take two passes to move the disc.
It&rsquo;s a good option when the defense isn&rsquo;t covering quickly or when you are
worried about the wind.</p>
<p>Your upfield players must <strong>get into position quickly</strong>. If they do this, you
are basically already running your offense. You may define a first set that is
different from your flow, but it is still key to get into it. If even a single
player lags behind, that&rsquo;s one defender who can mess up the works.</p>
<p><strong>Have a language.</strong> There should be clear communication as the pull comes in.
Define who will say what and exactly what that person will say. For example,
some teams will choose the side of the field to attack while the pull is in
the air â€” if so, know who is calling that (is it the person to receive the
first pass? the option?), know what to say (if you say &ldquo;left&rdquo; which side is
that?), and know what the options are. Even just saying &ldquo;You got time&rdquo; makes a
difference. The pull receiver can then think about one thing â€” catching the
pull. When calling the offense/positions before the pull, it should be known
who says what.</p>
<p><strong>Get some yards, but don&rsquo;t stress about it.</strong> Try to get some yards on the
first pass, but it is more important that this is a good, safe pass. There is
no reason to push this one and try to get too much. This will dictate your
setup. Your up-field players should plan to set up based on where the person
receiving the first pass will be. This means that person needs to get to this
spot quickly. The location will depend on the quality of the pull and the
speed of the defense. I would also suggest that this person plan to get to a
spot and then move back towards the thrower a bit. That gives a little more
leeway for a mistake on the throw â€” that first pass can be harder than you
think.</p>
<p><strong>Look!</strong> Never marry a setup. Look at the D.</p>

    <h4><a href="https://the-huddle.indiaultimate.org/issue-027/the-catch-to-the-hitch/" itemprop="headline">The Catch To The Hitch</a></h4>
    
        <p><a href="/author/adam-sigelman/">Adam Sigelman</a></p>
    
    <p>I have traditionally posted to this website with answers that questioned the
question instead of answered it. I feel that I owe Ben and Andy a single
straightforward response.</p>
<p>My teams have traditionally fielded the pull with the three handlers. The
&ldquo;Catch,&rdquo; not surprisingly, catches the pull. I am surprised how often capable
players choose to let pulls hit the ground instead of catching them on the
fly. I encourage attempting to catch all but the most vertical of pulls. The
risk of dropping the pull, in my opinion, is overrated.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Catch&rdquo; then throws to the &ldquo;Hitch&rdquo;. Before that throw happens, however,
the &ldquo;Hitch&rdquo; has positioned himself on his preferred side of the field, where
he plans on eventually throwing the disc. He announces this side of the field
loudly to all of the players in the stack (i.e. &ldquo;Play Left!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Left Side!&rdquo;).
Note that in a horizontal stack, the &ldquo;play side&rdquo; is always in the middle of
the field, and the &ldquo;Hitch&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t need to communicate the &ldquo;play side&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important that the &ldquo;Hitch&rdquo; gain as many yards as possible without risking
a block. Many first throws do not take advantage of this free yardage before
the defense is set.</p>
<p>There is always a third handler who is neither called as the &ldquo;Hitch&rdquo; nor the
&ldquo;Catch&rdquo;. The role of this handler is to provide a second option should a
speedy defender take away the first pass. He typically goes on the opposite
side of the &ldquo;play side&rdquo;. If the &ldquo;Hitch&rdquo; catches the first throw, the 3rd
handler is now setting the stack. If a defender takes away the throw to the
&ldquo;play side&rdquo;, the &ldquo;Catch&rdquo; can throw to the 3rd handler on the opposite side of
the field for an attempt up this side of the field.</p>

    <h4><a href="https://the-huddle.indiaultimate.org/issue-027/unfailing-terminology/" itemprop="headline">Unfailing Terminology</a></h4>
    
        <p><a href="/author/lou-burruss/">Lou Burruss</a></p>
    
    <p>Catching the pull requires four players: a 1, a 2, a Short Fill, and a Deep
Fill. Everyone else can have their heads up their asses and it&rsquo;ll be okay.</p>
<p>The 1&rsquo;s job is to catch the pull and make the first pass.</p>
<p>The 2&rsquo;s job is to set themselves up to catch the first pass, catch the first
pass and then deliver the big throw to the 3.</p>
<p>The Short Fill&rsquo;s job is to read the pull and the defense. If the first pass
isn&rsquo;t going to be contested they say, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re okay.&rdquo; If the defense is going
to cover the first pass, the SF says, &ldquo;The D is on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Deep Fill&rsquo;s job is to read the pull and set the stack in the correct
place. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be the Deep Fill, it could be the 4 or the 7. It
should be someone who knows what they are doing and can read the field.</p>
<p>A note on the terminology: it&rsquo;s NYNY&rsquo;s. The play goes 1 to 2 to 3 to 4 with
Short Fill, Deep Fill, and 7 stepping in as necessary should the play break
down. You will find that this terminology is good and will hold regardless of
what kind of offense you are running. Basically, your 1 is your set up man,
your 2 is your hucker, your 3 is your best player and in-out threat, and your
4 is your deep threat.</p>
