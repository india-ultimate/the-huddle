"Successful teams, sometimes by accident, but more often by design,
share amongst their members a common set of values, attitudes and goals.
These characteristics define the identity of a given team, and
ultimately create the culture of that team." -- John Korber

"If team culture is simply a set commonly held attitudes and beliefs
about a team, then the reason for wanting to encourage helpful culture
is straightforward: it helps performance." -- John Sandahl  

"The most important thing to realize about your team’s culture is that
it will change every season." -- Miranda Roth
