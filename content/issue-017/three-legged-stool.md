Think of the opposing team's offense as a three-legged stool. You want to
knock it over. Do you kick the sturdiest leg? No, that'd be silly. Kick the
weak leg.  
  
Look, marquee players are going to get theirs. You can put your best defender
on them, rotate defenders, do what you want; they are still going to get open,
still get the disc and still make throws. But we all know Ultimate isn't a one
person game. That marquee player cannot function without the other six players
on the field.  
  
Analyze your opponent's overall strategy and look for a piece of it that you
can shut down. Look for people who are doing the little things. An offense
cannot run without the little things and often the people who are delivering
them aren't used to dealing with the best defenders. Who is throwing the swing
to the hucker? Who is consistently catching comebacks on stalling seven? Who
is getting open for a reset dump? Find that player, shut that player down and
your opponent's offense will suffer.
