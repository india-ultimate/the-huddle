Once you've flipped for shirt color, you are very unlikely to suddenly
increase the ability of your defensive players. These are your assets,
they are your chess pieces.Â 

We asked our authors for a look into how they think about their
defensive matchups. How do you use your pieces against the other team?
This is an incredibly complicated question, and we've specifically asked
our authors to work without much information. What are the basic pieces
of designing a defensive strategy? How should matchups be used in a
point, a game or a tournament? How should you use your Queen (your
superstar defender) most effectively?

Maybe most importantly, when do you pull the plug on a matchup and make
a change? Too quick of a trigger as a coach and you aren't allowing your
best player enough chances to make a difference. But wait too long and
their player has a field day on a great matchup for them. These are
interesting questions for anyone that wants to coach or understand what
other team's coaches and captains are doing.
