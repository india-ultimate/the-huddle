A quality warm up should simply prepare the body for the work to follow. What
is to follow? A match of our beautiful, dynamic sport that involves sprinting,
jumping, throwing, marking and changing direction...  
  
Ok, so how do we prepare for all that?  

### The New School Warm Up:

  
_Pros:_ The most effective way to prepare the body to work out  
  
_Cons:_ Takes a relatively long time, requires tools, is not flashy  
  
Here are all the components, in order:

  * **_Roll_** (foam roll, lacrosse ball, stick) to decrease tissue density. SUPER IMPORTANT!  

  * **_Static stretch_** to increase tissue length 
    * _Note, in Ultimate, the hip may be the single most important area to stretch. Think about the hips as having four quadrants and makes sure to hit them all! Partner stretches work great._
      * _Inside Hip or Groin: Partner Seated Split Stretch_
      * _Outside Hip or Gluts: Chest to Shin Stretch_
      * _Front Side Hip or Hip Flexors: Kneeling Hip Flexor Stretch_
      * _Backside Hip or Hamstring Group: Partner Hamstring Stretch_
  * **_Mobilize_** or increase range of motion of a joint. Pay lots of attention to ankle, hip and thoracic spine.  

  * **_Activate_** (mini-bands, stretch bands) or "turn on" some smaller yet important muscles (i.e. glut medius, rhomboids)  

  * **_Reinforce_** patterns seen in sport (sprinting, jumping, and cutting and lateral movement mechanics)  

What this accomplishes? We have rubbed out the bumpy dense pieces of tissue to
prepare them to be lengthened (rolling). We have lengthened the tissue
(stretching) and mobilized the joints to allow for greater range of motion. We
have activated important muscles and trained our neuromuscular system to
recognize and replicate patterns we may encounter in the game. We are warm,
supple, and moving well. We are ready to jam.  
  

### The Old School warm up:

  
_Pros:_ Time efficient, requires no tools  
  
_Cons:_ Fails to address tissue density, tissue length and activation  
  
The "new era" warm up is the most effective way to prepare the body for
exercise. Though to some, it may seem unpractical…  
  
_"Do you really expect me to bring my foam roller and stretch bands to the
field and spend 20 minutes rolling and static stretching before I play?"_  
If you want to perform at the highest possible level, Yes.  
  
_"Whatever, I am just going to take my team through some traditional cone to
cone dynamic warm ups"_  
That is fine. Though conventional cone to cone style team warm ups may not be
the most effective means of warm up, they do have benefits. For example, it
does create team chemistry. Teams look organized and sometimes intimidating if
everyone on the team is on the same page as they go through all the dynamic
patterns. Also, it may be the best way to warm up when in a crunch for time.  
  
I have accepted that until athletes become more educated, the majority of
teams will warm up this way no matter how much time is available. Therefore,
here are a few tips if you chose this route:  

  * _**Reinforce fundamental linear running/ jump mechanics.**_ i.e. A March, Sprinters Skip, High Knee Run, Starts, Transition Jog to Back pedal to Jog, Approach Step Single Leg Jump – Approach Step Double Leg Jump  

  * _**Reinforce fundamental cutting/ lateral movement patterns.**_ i.e. Shuffle, "In- Out-In" Cut , Jab Step with Serpentine Pattern, Lateral Skip, Lateral Cross Over Skip, Lateral Bounding to Sprint  

  * _**Use lunge variations.**_ i.e. Spiderman Lunge, Cross Over Lunge, Opposite Elbow to Opposite Ankle Lunge  

  * _**Use groin openers.**_ i.e. Squat and Pivot, Squat Hops, Side Squat to Side Shuffle  

  * _**Pay special attention to hamstrings**_ (especially when deep into tournaments) and hit them from all angles. i.e. Frankenstein, Walking Toe Touch, Single Leg Reach, Inch Worm  

  * _**Don’t forget to Hit Upper Body.**_ i.e. Trunk Twists, Arm Circles, Windmills  

  * _**Be Creative!**_ Combine movements together to add variety. Ie. Lateral Shuffles with Arm Circles, Push Up to Inchworm to Reach for the Sky, Long Lunge to Hip-up to Tall Lunge and Twist  

  * _**Have private time.**_ Every "body" is different. After your warm ups, allow time to each player to handle individual issues. You should know your body well enough to know what you need to feel just perfect. Perhaps it is some additional hamstring stretches or using "the stick" on a tight piece of tissue.  

In sum, Ultimate is an extremely demanding sport. In order to ensure
longevity, remain injury free and perform at the highest possible level we
must spend time rolling and stretching (decreasing density, increasing length)
and taking care of our individual issues. Though foam rolling and static
stretching may take time, cause relative discomfort and not look very
intimidating, they are essential. And yes, static stretching before exercise
is perfectly fine, despite what you may have heard.  
  
Circumstances may not always allow this prior to every game. If this is the
case, use an old school warm up to increasing body temperature, reinforces
patterns and gets you feeling relatively loose.  
  
I have a feeling we are going to be seeing a lot more players rolling around
on cylinders or foam and PVC at tournaments. Others may see that guy and think
"what the heck is he doing rolling on the ground, he looks silly" I agree it
may a little silly at times but [as a strength
coach](http://www.morrillperformance.com/), I love it.  
  
When I see it I think "now, there is an educated athlete, good for him!"  
  
Perhaps that should be you.  
  
Bottom Line: high level educated warm up = high level play
