Everyone knows how to mark. As Ben van Heuvelen puts it, the combination
of low hips, balance and wide arms are widely perceived as the first
steps to a good mark. What do you do once you are playing at a level
where a "generally good mark" just isn't good enough? What are the
tricks that some of the top players are using?

We noticed, in going through these articles, that most of these tricks
are the kind of things that players do after many years of experience at
high levels. They are also the kind of things that tend to separate
players that could be great defenders from those that tend to be on the
field when the team is getting a block. Want to help your team control
the offense? Read on to find out how others are doing it (or having it
done to them).
