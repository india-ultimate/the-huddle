You need Chris Page. Chris who? Remember back when Sockeye was good the first
time? Back in the 90s and you watched those epic battles on NBC? Dreaming of
how it was gonna be you? Sockeye-Double Happiness? Sockeye-Rhino? All those
heart-breakers against DoG? Remember that shaggy headed blonde kid ripping it
forehand, backhand, marked, didn't matter? That was Chris Page.  
  
When I hit the big time in 96, I had some power, but no control. None. Pager
and I would go out to Red Square and rip for hours, throwing everything.
Starting with regular forehands and backhands, but after a while, towering
blades, spot-benders around the sculptures, huge inside-outs kissing off the
buildings. I threw as hard as I could and he still had ten yards on me. And
touch.  
  
Eventually, though, I got there. So the message to you is: go find someone who
loves to throw and who is much better than you. Go throw with them until you
are better than they are.
