Great defensive handlers are typically people who are aggressive, able to see
the field really well, and have a solid understanding of when it is
appropriate to play transition offense. In my opinion, one of the most
important parts of being a defensive handler is leading your team when you
guys do get the D. This may be calling a play, running to the disc to
transition, creating space for a teammate, or cutting to get the disc off the
transition. I think one of the most brutal things to have happen to your team
is to turn the disc over and have the other team score within 2-3 passes.
Therefore, if you are a defensive handler your goal should be to move the disc
away from the defense immediately and start marching up the field.  
  
One player who is an amazing example of a defensive handler, who I have been
lucky enough to be teammates with, is Andrea "Chowda" Jung. She is and
incredible defender and because she is such a threat as a thrower she runs our
offense right off of the turnover. By Chowda getting the offense going
quickly, the other team can't get the right match ups quickly, and we have the
opportunity for an easy score.
