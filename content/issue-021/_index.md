Team USA leaves today for the other side of the Pacific, where they will
defend the World Games Ultimate title that the USA won in Germany in
2005. After months of tryouts, track workouts, flying around the country
for scrimmages and tournaments and a final cut, the team is finally
ready to play for hardware.

We were lucky enough to find ten members of Team USA who could answer
questions about their specialties.Â 

Thanks to Head Coach Greg Connelly and the UPA's Josh Seamon for their
help in putting together this issue.
