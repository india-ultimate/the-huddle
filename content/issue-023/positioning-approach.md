While we call these hangers "50/50 discs," I would bet that at the moment the
disc is coming down an observer would have a better than coin-flip chance of
guessing who will touch the disc first. Keying in on the information informing
that decision will help guide a player in giving themselves a better than
coin-flip chance of getting to it first.  
  
I think that beyond obvious physical differences ("I like the guy who is 6'8"
over the short guy") the two main components are positioning and approach. If
you're at the spot early you may want to position yourself so that someone
else approaching on a dead run isn't going to be able to have a clean takeoff
and take it at their highest point. This doesn't mean you are not playing the
disc, but it does mean that you are going to play the disc in a way that
allows you to reduce your opponent's chance of taking it at a higher point
than you.  
  
Related to this is the approach. If there are three people standing still
under the disc and one guy is coming in with a clean running jump, I like the
guy on the outside. This means that if you are going to be the third or fourth
man in the pile, it might be better to hold up for a second and try to time it
so you jump over the group. This is easier said than done, but we've all seen
pictures of people getting roofed because they're stuck standing still while
another guy had a clean jumping approach.
