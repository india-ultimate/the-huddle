In order to catch a 50/50 disc a player needs to be able to do a number of
things correctly to win the battle.  
  
**1\. Reading**  
The player must be able to read the disc and understand how the wind and the
way the disc was thrown is going to affect its flight path.  
  
**2\. Positioning**  
Once that player has a good grasp of where that disc is going to float down to
earth, that player must establish that position firmly. This, establishing and
maintaining your position, does take strength, and if a player thinks that
they can continue to compete at high levels without weight training, they are
out of their minds.  
  
**3\. Jump**  
The player must be able to jump higher than the other people in this group who
are also trying to do #1 and #2. If you do number one and number two
perfectly, but do not have as high of a vertical as someone else in this
cluster, there is still a chance you will come down with that disc. If you
want to ensure that it is you that is going to catch that disc, get yourself
on a plyometric program and increase your vertical. With jumping also comes
**timing your jump**. Timing your jump is also a skill that can be worked on.
Every time you go tossing, practice timing your catch with reaching the peak
of your vertical. he more you are able to catch discs at the peak of your
vertical in practice, the more likely you will be able to do this in a game
situation. This takes timing and knowing when the disc is at the right height
for you.  
  
**4\. Catching The Disc**  
You have read the disc right, you got the position, you can jump higher than
anyone else, and you have perfect timing on your jump. Now, catch that piece
of plastic! Snatch it out of the air! Grab it! Do not gently try to pull it
out of the air. Catch with authority. Practice catching with one hand.
Practice catching with your left. Practice catching with your right. Practice
catching. Do not let yourself casually drop it even when tossing. Remember,
perfect practice makes perfect.
