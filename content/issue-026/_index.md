In an effort to attack offenses when the disc is on the sideline, many
teams use a 'rotated' mark to take away the reset. As the mark shifts to
cut off the 45-degree angle backwards, the reset defenders shift to take
away the upfield reset cut, effectively bracketing the thrower's 'safe'
options.

As an offensive player, what do you look for to break this defensive
strategy? As a coach, how do you prepare to play against this defensive
scheme?
