Rotating the mark can be a very effective strategy against teams that
effectively use the reset to work the disc upfield when the initial cut isn't
open. This defense works best when it has the element of surprise behind it.
However, like many defenses, if offenses recognize that this strategy is being
used they can develop a plan to counter it.  
  
The easiest thing to think about is what the defense gives up when they
implement this strategy. The obvious thing is the inside-out throw that gets
the disc off the line. Having an upfield cutter make a move back to the middle
of the field after making a hard cut to the line will frequently be an easy
way to take advantage. Another option is to shift the stack closer to the
sideline so that there is more space to the inside-out side of the stack for
the thrower to use and for cutters to cut.  
  
If a team is determined to get the disc to the reset, one adjustment to make
is to have the reset wait for a thrower-initiated throw. This keeps the
throwing space more open for the thrower, giving larger room for error. If the
reset moves early and winds up behind the disc on that sideline there is very
little space for the thrower.  
  
Finally, when that mark moves around, there is really no pressure on the
upfield huck. A patient thrower should be able to use this to get off an
uncontested huck if he has the confidence to wait until late in the count.
