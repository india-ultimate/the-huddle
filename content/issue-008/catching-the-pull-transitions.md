**Catching The Pull**  
Mentally, catching the pull is often thought of as being a job that one can
only mess up, but the flip side is to think of it as an opportunity for a team
to jump start its offense. The seconds saved by catching the pull help to get
the offense in motion before the defense can set. I think of three main steps
when catching the pull:  
  
**1\. Anticipation.** Learn about the opposing team's pullers, especially
focusing on the distance of their pulls and angle of the throw (I/O or O/I are
the predominant favorites). Obviously prior game experience will help, but
this can be learned during the course of a game just as easily.  
  
**2\. Reading and Decision Making.** For the pulls that I am going to catch, I
try to get my body to where I can catch the disc at chest height. I turn to
face the direction of its incoming path. For whatever reason I might decide
not to catch the pull (for example it is raining and/or the disc is coming in
at a really steep angle) I will get my body to where I think the disc is going
to be easiest to pickup and throw right away. This is easy for a floating pull
that settles nicely to the ground, but for a roller, anticipating the roll and
getting to the right spot can be tricky.  
  
**3\. Execution.** I want to pancake the pull at chest height and close to my
body. I focus on keeping my hands at 90 degree angles to each other (as
opposed to parallel) to eliminate misalignment and the chance that the disc
might flip out of my hands.  
  
**Transition From Catching To Throwing**  
The ability to catch and throw as quickly as possible is often undervalued as
a handler attribute. Fortunately, it is easy to practice because it can be
worked on as part of any throwing drill by trying to catch and release as fast
as you can.  
  
Getting your feet into a balanced throwing position should be done
simultaneous to catching. Tenths of a second can be the difference between
hitting the swing or having the mark come on to prevent you from hitting the
swing.(Sidebar: from playing the Japanese women at Worlds, this was something
that they all seemed to excel at). As a right-handed thrower, I mostly pancake
with my right hand on top so that sliding into a backhand grip is very quick.
Coming out of the pancake, right-hand on top is also the most natural and
secure motion for me to enter into my forehand grip.
