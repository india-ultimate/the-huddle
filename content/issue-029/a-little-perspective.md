Field vision is the ability to understand the dynamics of the opposition's
offense or defense despite being embroiled in a battle against it. Every team
has players who see plays happen/develop (be it from on the pitch or the
sideline), and compile the information to start the next point with the
knowledge they just took on board (and, importantly, can dispense it to their
teammates). It is these adaptive players that win tight matches.  
  
The natural ability to analyze mid-experience is difficult to develop but not
impossible. Two simple steps are watch as much Ultimate as you can and then
help to coach. Moving from playing to coaching forces players to look at the
game in a new light; not only do you need to see everything that happens on
the pitch, but now you have the chance to do it because you're on the
sideline.  
  
Personally, I find it very difficult to analyze a game as it develops when I'm
playing a part in it. My mind needs to focus on the immediate — on the task at
hand at that very second. If I want more than that I need to get off the
field, watch a little and then figure it out — usually time that I do not
have. It wasn't until I started coaching that I began to realize how much I
had been missing.
