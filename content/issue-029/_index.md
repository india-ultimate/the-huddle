\"How did they see that?\"

Some players, whether through experience or natural talent, seem to
understand what is happening on the field at all times. Those players
have an advantage with the disc in their hands as they are able to pick
out open players, even if the cutter didn\'t know they were open! They
tend to be intelligent cutters and savvy defenders. Why?Â 

How did you develop field vision? Who have you played with or against
that had great field vision? How would you define this ability? How can
it be taught, or learned by a motivated player?
