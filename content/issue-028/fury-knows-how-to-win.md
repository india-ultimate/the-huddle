Fury, more than any other Women's team in the nation (perhaps ever, though
there will be those who argue for Godiva or Maineiacs), knows what to do in
Sarasota.  
  
Each player seems to have a very good grasp of her specific role from the top
of the roster to the bottom. Everyone plays that role perfectly when push
comes to shove. They don't mess around against teams they know they will beat,
and they bring it hard to teams that might have entertained thoughts of having
a chance.  
  
In the end, I think that the former is more important than the latter — anyone
can decide to bring it in a big game, but the question is how much do they
have left to bring? This became glaringly obvious in the heat, sun, and
humidity of Florida this year, not to mention the wind of years previous. This
year when other teams (mine included) bled points to teams they had beaten all
season long, Fury was done with each game early and was already resting in the
shade when others were playing into the cap. Over a 4-day tournament time is
ridiculously important. I think the particular skills they showed were less on
the field (though those, as always, were impeccable) and more off the field —
preparation, role definition and mental toughness.  
  
Congratulations, yet again!
