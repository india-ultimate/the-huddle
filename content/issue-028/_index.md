Fury and Chain Lightning (as well as Axis Of C\'Ville and Troubled Past)
played incredibly well and with great Spirit in Sarasota last October,
and they deserve their plaudits. It is not for the champions to tell us
how they won; it is our task to try and decipher what made these teams
so successful, and how it might be copied or contained at the next
tournament. If that is possible, we think it is the players who saw
these teams at full strength last fall that likely have the best clues.

What did the champions do very well? Did their team have a particular
strength that they rode throughout the tournament?

Do the champions have any weaknesses, or are we left hoping that they
somewhat regress? What might you do differently in 2010 in an attempt to
beat them? What should other teams do in order to train for victory over
these top teams?
