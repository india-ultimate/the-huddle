During DoG's heyday 15 years ago, our main offensive strength was that we
would take what they'd give us. Our offense was efficient, not just in terms
of scoring percentage, but in using energy wisely. Players created space by
knowing when to get out of the way or to simply stay put and remain out of the
way. We liked the long game, but were equally comfortable in taking a series
of passes up the line. We relied on our O players knowing each other, and we'd
give our receivers options (see above point about getting out of the way) and
trust that the throwers could get it there.  
  
From reading the writeups of Chain's O last year and from watching the
championship game video, I was dumbstruck by the similarities. Compared to the
frenetic movements of Sockeye's receivers, Chain's cutters would often be
stationary (though not clogging), and reset cuts were available. They hucked
efficiently, but they also would take the reset. Players had specialities, but
that wasn't all they did. Their receivers could throw effectively. They broke
the mark when they had to and keep the disc moving.  
  
To continue winning, Chain needs to keep their O together and to make subtle
adjustments based on players' changing skills and on defensive adjustments. If
they codify the way they are doing things now as "the way," teams will adjust
and their players will change and they'll spend years trying to recapture the
glory.
