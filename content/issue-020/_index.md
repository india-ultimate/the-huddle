You\'re down 11-7, game to 15. Your defense needs to score four times to
tie the game up. How do you manage a comeback? How do you call lines?
What do you tell yourself and your players?Â 

What\'s a successful attitude and approach in this situation? We asked
our authors to think back on their own successful (or unsuccessful)
comeback stories and help us set a game plan for recovering for an early
deficit.
