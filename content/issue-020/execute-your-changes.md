If you are behind because the team has something you can't handle (a few
players or a defense) you are not behind, you are getting beaten. Change it
up. Play a different D, run the counter play, even if you have to invent it.
Maybe the risk means you go down 13-7 and later people whisper about how you
got blown out. But if you can't get the score to 11-9 or 12-10 so what?

  
There is no all-the-time rule for who to play and what to say. Depends on the
game, the time of year, and the opponent. But, do your team's top
playersdeserve the opportunity to climb out of a hole they probably dug? Or is
now as good a time as any to find out who else can get it done? Is the change
a prayer or include some combinations you have practiced once in a while?  
  
What are the one or two technical things everyone needs to do to close the
gap? Stop their tall recievers from going deep? Slow down the give and go?
It's fun to see if you can make those changes and execute. Maybe not the
script as you would have written it, butthe kind of opportunity you and your
team should love once its there, whatever happens. Or did you really think you
were going to win everygame 15-7?
