_"Be careful what you wish for."_  
â€” Ken Dobyns over the phone, NYC to Hampton Bays, August 1995.  
  
Calling the D line that season isn't something I necessarily wished for, but
blindly accepted the vacancy; possibly a dumb move for a not proved new face
on a second year team still fielding much of the leftover NYNY dynasty. We
beat Boston four times that season: Regionals, Tune-up, and two small pre-
season tourneys. And that season we lost two games, both at Nationals: Sockeye
in pool play, and Boston in the semi-finals.  
  
_"If you don't step up your game, quit calling yourself in!"_  
  
This said with spittle flying everywhere; and that comment is watered down
compared to others heard and learned of later, not to mention the immediate
silence encountered after hobbling down the hall and popping into room 237.  
  
As a spectator in 2002, I hustled over to see the end of the Furious/Boston
semi after Ring defeated Sockeye in the other semifinal. I found myself
standing behind a handful of Sockeye players seated along the sideline. They
were not quite digesting the big let down and were busy chewing on the bitter
pill, calling out the late-game leadership and decision making, dragging
everyone under the bus. All of the trust building drills throughout the course
of the season seemed to be a pitiful waste. Though rotation wasn't the issue,
part of me was them. Weeks before I watched, somewhat helplessly, a 14-10 lead
on Ring and a sure ticket to Nationals slip away as Ring rolled off five for
the win and a spot in the Regional final. The old Gas House Gorillas routine
was certainly overlooked that day.  
  
A place in the sun isn't meant for everyone (and Sockeye's casting a long
shadow), and when the chips fall the other way, a thankless job is, indeed,
thankless.  
  
Be careful what you wish for.
