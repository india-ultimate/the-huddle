The most terrifying aspect of captaining or coaching, for many players,
is being responsible for deciding who plays, and when. In this issue,
we\'ll discuss the thought processes that go into making these
decisions.

In this issue of The Huddle we have asked our roster of authors to dish
out advice about strategies for line calling. We gave them a
hypothetical: your team\'s regular sub-caller is becoming curiously mute
just before Regionals, and must pass on what she knows about sub-calling
to a teammate before she loses her voice completely.

Are there tried-and-true formulas, schemes, and patterns for superior
sub-calling? And who makes the best person to call lines? Answers to
these questions and more.
