I've been very fortunate in my career to play on many successful teams that
did not call subs, and this hypothetical situation could be a blessing in
disguise. Most players at elite levels are fairly self-aware, and after a
season of playing together most can recognize the hierarchy within the team
and could make an honest appraisal of their optimum contribution to the team
in terms of quantity and type (O or D) of points.  
  
Some players may have to be told more explicitly ahead of time (and reminded
during a game) but most will have a good idea. At its best, allowing players
to put themselves in the game empowers them to control their contribution, to
put themselves in when they are feeling ready, and gives the rest of the team
confidence in them.  
  
This may not work for every team, but I have been a part of very successful
groups where self-subbing was an ingrained part of the team structure, took
the onus of subbing off one person and distributed it to everyone, and created
an environment of success which pushed each player in practice and games to
achieve their best on the field.
