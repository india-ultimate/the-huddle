To me, Spirit of the Game has two principal components: respect (don't be an
ass) and integrity (don't be a cheater). I think you could go through reams of
paper defining how those two principles should and do play out, which is not
my intent here.  
  
My point is that playing with Spirit is much harder than I think we give it
credit for. What we are asking of people is to fight against their ego, their
desire for appreciation and status. These are basic human desiresâ€”humans
compete for them in all sorts of arenas (money, popularity, who can hook up
with the most attractive member of the opposite sex, and, of course, sport). I
believe it's possible and worthwhile to attempt to overcome those desires, but
it's a much more arduous process than just deciding to do so.  
  
As a player, I'm probably worse than most in the Spirit category. When I lose
my temper, I'm prone to make bad calls, treat the rules as guidelines, or
raise my voice in argument. I'm not proud of this behavior.  
  
At the same time, I value the challenge. It's an opportunity to get to know
the demons that lurk inside of us, and, with hard work, allows us to get rid
of one or two. I value a sport that asks its athletes to take on this
challenge.
