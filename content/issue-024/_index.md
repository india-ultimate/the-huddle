Big Ideas are hard, and they are complicated. Justice is a Big Idea. If I want
to know about Justice, it doesn't help to ask a bunch of philosophy students for
one-liners. To really learn about Justice, I want to find criminals, victims,
cops, defense attorneys, and those falsely accused. I want to get into what it
means to live with Justice, or to live without it.

I think that if someone tries to tell you in one sentence what Spirit is then
all you have learned is that this person doesn't understand the Idea. It's more
complicated than that, and it is complicated because some parts of you might
want to live with that Idea, and others don't. What matters, to me, is trying to
understand how the people in the mix, the people actually dealing with the
ramifications and who have the most to gain and lose from it. I've played with
cheaters and I've played with idealists and I've played with a lot of other
folks that didn't classify well. I'm more sure than ever that Spirit of the Game
is a Big Idea, and that it is worth our time and thought.
