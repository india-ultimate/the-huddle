Spirit of the Game is easy when the game doesn't matter...but that is
certainly not the case with Northwest Regionals. Every game is a battle and
every game is intense. In my opinion, it is when the UPA Series starts that
Spirit matters most.  
  
The best players in the game can play at an incredibly high level without
compromising their personal integrity or the reputation of their team. I think
that sometimes Spirit of the Game is mistaken for not contesting calls or not
being willing to make a call, but really it is honoring your opponents and
yourself by playing 100% and making calls if true violations or fouls occur. I
really enjoy the moments in Ultimate when someone makes a call and then after
a quick discussion realizes it wasn't the right call and takes it back. I am a
true believer that SOTG is something that sets our sport apart from others and
for the better. I am proud to be able to say that I have played at the highest
level of this sport without the assistance of referees.  
  
I know, for me personally, there is something very rewarding about battling
with an opponent and then turning around and giving them a high five when they
just skyed you in the endzone or got a sick layout D. I haven't experienced
that feeling in other sports growing up and it is moments like those that make
me feel incredibly proud to be an Ultimate player.
