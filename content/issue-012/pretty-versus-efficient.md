From an elementary basketball analogy (sorry readership to those that know a
lot about basketball), if everyone is doing their job, the point guard is
keeping the ball alive and getting it into the post when available for the
forwards and center to finish off. Much like this, in open field, the handlers
are keeping the disc alive and looking to get it to the cutters whenever
available. To this end, the cutters are the primary workhorses during this
phase of the offense by getting the big gains and opening up the downfield.
Once the disc is within the red zone, it is then time for the handlers to earn
their keep.  
  
Back to the beginning, as a cutter, I am getting into my position in the
endzone structure my team uses (vertical or horizontal) as quickly as possible
to get my legs/breath back. I am assuming of course that we don't have a
fastbreak opportunity or offensive advantage in running the disc quickly. Now,
most teams I have played with like to use some sort of endzone play to score
as it seems, and can be, effective. However, this is likely to correlate to
something pretty or conventional. Pretty usually entails a dump-swing followed
by some options from cutters followed by another dump-swing and repeated. Now,
I am tired so my cut is unlikely to be at 100% which makes it more difficult
to get open, let alone, there is a not-too-small probability that if I do get
open, there will be a poach. This leads to me becoming more tired, and the
endzone offense taking longer to score, which is contrary to my initial hope
and team goal of an efficient endzone offense.  
  
Lets look at this mathematically speaking (extremely simplified but hopefully
understandable). Assume:  
  
Probability of completed dump or swing = **95%**  
Probability of completed upfield throw = **90%**  
  
Let's also assume that these events are independent of one another, and an
upfield throw equates to a score.  
  
Now, our "pretty" offense dumps and swings, and that option isn't on so we
dump-swing again and then get an upfield option, the probability of this
endzone offense scoring is:  
**(.95)*(.95)*(.95)*(.95)*(.9) = .733 probability of scoring.**  
  
If our endzone doesn't score on that dump-swing, and has to go again, that
makes probability of scoring equal to .666.  
  
So, our pretty offense can quickly lead to a turn with our tired cutters,
which will make our cutters even more tired once we get the disc back due to
their previous defensive responsibilities.  
  
Back to the original topic, I have gone to my position quickly to rest and
watch the offense. Instead of sticking to our pretty offense where I might
make a power cut on my turn to cut, I am going to rest and wait. I will let
the handlers earn their keep as I said before by letting them move the disc
quickly and get the defense shifting around. Then, once I see a thrower I know
well, and have a connection with, get the disc with his defender tailing or
out of position, I will look to make my move. I will look to see where my
defender's momentum and the thrower's defender's momentum is going, consider
what my thrower is willing to throw and what he prefers to throw, and try to
match all of these conditions.  
  
By this I mean, find the space in the endzone, opposite my defender's
momentum, that opens up the throw my handler prefers to use (no matter how
ridiculous or unconventional).  
  
Personally, my favorite endzone is a vert stack that is stacked 1/3 of the
width away from open side sideline, leaving 2/3 of the width of the field
breakside, and letting the handler throw a scoob, high release, or low release
into that space for any cutter to run onto.  
  
Back to our (extremely simplified) mathematical analysis, if you choose the
throw the handler prefers (which should increase probability of success) then
this can lead to a higher probability of scoring in a more efficient manner,
which is what the cutter wanted from the beginning.  
  
So, this isn't pretty, but can get the job done in a more efficient manner
with an equal to higher percentage of scoring. Assume:  
  
Probability of getting disc to middle of field = **95%**  
Probability of unconventional throw into endzone = **85%**  
**(.95)*(.85) = .8075 probability of scoring.**  
  
In conclusion, as a cutter, I want an offense that is extremely efficient so I
don't have to risk a turnover and more running, let alone, I want to score in
as little effort as possible for my sake and my teams. Letting the disc get to
the middle and then giving the handler room and time to break the mark makes
it easy on me as a cutter, and is a throw we practice time and time again.
