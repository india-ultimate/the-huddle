I'm usually thinking, "Get open on the open side."  
  
When fatigue sets in, throws and finesse are the first thing to go and open
side throws are generally easier. Cutters can push through fatigue with desire
and brute strength. So, to get open on the open side, I usually start facing
the thrower, juke hard toward the defender (they are on their heels), take a
few steps really hard to the break side (this usually lures the off-balance
defender to commit to the break side), then explode past them to the open side
(this may require some stepping past/running through limbs of your defender).
Try to add angle to the final cut so you're not cutting directly at the
sidelineâ€”give your thrower a bigger window with an angle at the front or back
cone.
