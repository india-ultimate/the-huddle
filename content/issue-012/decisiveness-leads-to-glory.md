Goal line cutting starts with decisiveness and ends in gloryâ€”either for your
or your teammates.  
  
When your team moves into its red zone offense, begin by moving quickly into
position. Your speed getting into position will determine whether they are
going to stay with you or leave you and poach the lane. When you sprint to
your attack point, your defender will instinctively feel like you are a threat
and attempt to stay with you. If you jog into position, a good defender will
take this opportunity to evaluate the field and put himself or herself in a
position to make a play.  
  
After reaching your attack point, take a jab step, give a head fake, do
something unpredictable to keep your defender's attention while you evaluate
the field and decide the best plan of attack. Make a decision, and execute it.  
  
By making your cut hard, you are clearing space for your teammates and
attracting the attention of not only your defender, but likely other defenders
around you, making it easier for the rest of the offense to get open. If you
get looked off, clear hard back into the stack to again create space for your
teammates. If your defender stays in the lane, take advantage and either go to
the break side of the field or attack the middle of the field and get the disc
in a powerful position.
