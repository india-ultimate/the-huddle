When I hear the "up" call I try to spot the disc, briefly and without giving
up any more ground.  
  
I need to ascertain if it has truly gone up, and if it is intended for the
player I am now chasing. If both of these things are true, then I try to make
some quick calculations based on what type of throw has been made.  
  

  * If it is low or short, I can simply go to it and have position underneath.  

  * If it is high, I need to catch up and try to establish a good position to jump at it. Ideally, it is a position where the player I am defending can't get a running leap at the disc, or a position where the player I am defending has to foul me to make a play.  

  * If the throw is long, I have to assess if I can make up the ground, to establish the position I just described, or try and sell my angle as to draw the player I am defending off his line, or now to defend me. (This could also be a strategy for high throws).

  
Also, as I am running through this situation I am aware, or try to be, of
where any help could be coming from. Likely: nowhere, since we were in the
back of the stack. However, if my player's in cut was "in" enough, I will have
some support deep.  
  
I think you have a better chance to make the play or have them miss it if they
are less athletic. If they are more athletic, I would probably force more
under and try to block the away cut. I don't think the force matters too much,
except where you might look as the "up" call happens as it will limit the some
throwers options.
