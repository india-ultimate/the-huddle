Even though the answer to this question is pretty straightforward—a surprising
number of club players make errors on this play.  
  
First of all, if I am only a stride or two behind my check when a huck goes up
then I am feeling pretty good about my positioning. Only a perfectly thrown
disc will not allow me to have a play on it. Secondly—and this is where many
players make an error—I always make the inside play on the disc. No matter
your height or the height of your opponent, it is always more difficult for
someone to jump over you to make a catch. On occasion, when I am boxed out and
lose the battle for position, I am invariably caught getting a close up view
of a sweaty butt in my face as my check catches the disc uncontested.  
  
At the elite levels, positioning is everything. Get in front. You may need to
push and battle for this positioning. If your opponent is way taller than you
and the disc is too high for you to touch, jump early and try to get them to
go up early too. If your opponent is only an inch or two taller than you (or
shorter) then go for the disc at your max. If you are in front and have
position, your jump should be plenty to make the play.  
  
Whatever you do...don't "snuggle" in behind. That is just bad ultimate.
