You're locked in on D against a downfield cutter when they plant and
head deep. Milliseconds later, the "Up!" call reaches your ears...the
deep ball is coming. What should you do? How do the best defenders
approach this crucial moment? How can you manufacture a D, and help your
team win? 

This issue of "The Huddle" focuses on these defensive questions. The
breadth of possible approaches underlies the differences in strategies
between players and teams and, we hope, will be useful for many
different kinds of players at all levels. Enjoy!
