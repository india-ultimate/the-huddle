In any offense, starting off organized and with a plan is essential to
moving down the field effectively and quickly. In this issue we take a
look at the very first seconds after the defense has pulled and the disc
is high into air. How do you field the pull? How many handlers to do you
hold back? What considerations do you make based on how deep the pull
goes, or which side of the field it lands on?

Our roster of authors explores everything that goes into efficiently
receiving the disc and moving upfield, and they also share tips to
eliminate common and correctable errors.

Enjoy.
