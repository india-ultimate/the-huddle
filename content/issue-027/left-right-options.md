First of all, I would be very intrigued to hear the Open authors' answers on
this question because, for the most part, Women's pulls do not involve a
ridiculous amount of rocket science to field (or maybe I have been missing out
on something for years).  
  
Typically, we will call a pull play where one person on the left side of the
field fields the pull if it goes left and one person on the right side of the
field fields the pull if it goes right. Therefore, within a second or two
after the puller releases the disc, the appropriate player calls out that they
will field the pull and feed it into a player that is in the center.  
  
If at all possible, it is pretty advantageous to catch the pull. When it is
windy — especially in Women's Ultimate — it may even be necessary to
**sprint** forward once the pull is thrown to try and catch it before it hits
the ground. That also means that your whole offensive line needs to be
sprinting forward as well. Also, it is smart to practice fielding rollers and
stopping rollers from obviously advancing in a direction to your disadvantage
— whether that be to the trap sideline or back towards your endzone.
