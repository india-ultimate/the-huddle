Catching the pull requires four players: a 1, a 2, a Short Fill, and a Deep
Fill. Everyone else can have their heads up their asses and it'll be okay.  
  
The 1's job is to catch the pull and make the first pass.  
  
The 2's job is to set themselves up to catch the first pass, catch the first
pass and then deliver the big throw to the 3.  
  
The Short Fill's job is to read the pull and the defense. If the first pass
isn't going to be contested they say, "You're okay." If the defense is going
to cover the first pass, the SF says, "The D is on."  
  
The Deep Fill's job is to read the pull and set the stack in the correct
place. It doesn't have to be the Deep Fill, it could be the 4 or the 7. It
should be someone who knows what they are doing and can read the field.  
  
A note on the terminology: it's NYNY's. The play goes 1 to 2 to 3 to 4 with
Short Fill, Deep Fill, and 7 stepping in as necessary should the play break
down. You will find that this terminology is good and will hold regardless of
what kind of offense you are running. Basically, your 1 is your set up man,
your 2 is your hucker, your 3 is your best player and in-out threat, and your
4 is your deep threat.
