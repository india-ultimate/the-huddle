The sideline is a great space to look to gain yardage. If your dump can beat
his defender up the line, it should be a relatively easy pass to space in
front of him, and he can then potentially hit a deep throw. This is probably
the best way to get off a high percentage huck (and doesn't necessarily need
to happen on the sideline). It's easy for the downfield cutters to time a deep
cut when they see this up-line cut developing, and the thrower can use his
momentum to get off a big throw.  
  
Of course, this is just one option. Like every other play ever drawn up, it
doesn't work every time. No matter what part of the field you want to attack,
you need to be able to move the disc off the sideline. Generally, an offense
is most effective when it changes the point of attack - that is, downfield
throws can (and do) come from the middle of the field and both sidelines. This
means using swing passes to move the disc laterally. Using the whole width of
the field puts far more stress on a defense than working down just one
sideline. If the disc stays on one sideline, the defenders can limit their
focus to cuts toward that sideline, so they only have to worry about guarding
in-cuts vs. out-cuts. On the other hand, when the defenders aren't sure where
the disc is being thrown from, it forces them to respect a cut to almost any
part of the field, making their job that much more difficult.
