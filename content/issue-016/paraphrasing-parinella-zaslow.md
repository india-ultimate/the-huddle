Moving the disc does one of three things:

  1. Gains ground (i.e. attacks)
  2. Moves you to a better place from which to attack
  3. Maintains possession

  
Because there is less room, the sideline can often be a harder place from
which to do 2 and 3. But if you can make space for your teammates, it can also
be an ideal place from which to attack.  
  
As always, personnel and approach determines much of what you do. A dominant
handler who can always get the disc makes the liability of going to other
players on the sideline less risky. A team that wants to send it often better
know how to get a few attacking looks once there. A team that likes to work
the disc or does not have a lot of downfield offense should spend less time on
the sideline and have a clear system for moving the disc back to the middle
and across the field.  
  
In practice, do lots of starts from the sideline. After a turn in a scrimmage
just stop for a second, throw the disc to the side and start again. If you are
comfortable on the sideline—attacking or moving off it—your team will excel.
