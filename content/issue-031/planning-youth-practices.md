**Elementary Ultimate (Ages 8-11) Beginners**  
Fun, fun fun.  
  
When it comes down to it, these guys just aren’t quite developed enough to
hold attention on one thing for anything longer than 15 minutes. So first
things first, you really have to chunk your practice out. Secondly, these kids
are just learning how to use their bodies in an athletic way and ultimately a
lot of what you do will be teaching them overall coordination and control of
their bodies. Lastly, you are probably introducing this game to the kids for
the first time in the life, teach them to love the game make every minute
exciting and fun! Get them started with an activity that doesn’t even involve
a disc or involves it but not in a conventional way. (Tag, Capture the
Frisbee, Relay races with the disc as a baton).  
  
Now that they are warmed up and hopefully a little bit tired, this would be
the time to teach them in their first chunk, whether it’s throwing, catching
or the basics on cutting you have about 15 to 20 minutes. The basic outline of
practice should alternate between a skill focused drill and a game that works
on that skill. It’s also important to remember when planning a practice for a
group of kids this age is to include an activity or game that really
emphasizes teamwork, sportsmanship, and spirit. Along with learning the game
these guys are still learning how to work with others and how to do it
respectfully in a competitive environment.

**Favorite drills/games for kids this age** | **Potential Practice Plan 1.5
hours**  
---|---  
  
  * Dog: two players run deep for a pass trying to catch it.
  * Frisbee tag: players who are "it" work together to pass the disc around and tag others with the disc or by throwing a soft pass at another player for them to become it as well. Played in an end zone.
  * Ladder drill races: team members must run ahead of the player with the disc and receive a pass to gain yards and make their way down the field. Players must throw and receive from the same player, teams of 4 or 5.

  * 0-10/15min: Warm up game
  * 15min-30: Partner throwing/catching
  * 30-45: Ladder relay drill
  * Break
  * 55min-1hr 10: Basic come to drill
  * 1:15-1:30: Dog Drill

  
  
  
**Middle School (Grade 11-14) Intermediate**  
This age can often be a tough group to plan a practice for. For developing
programs you may end up with a mix of kids some of which have never touched a
disc before and some of which have been playing for 3 years. Many of these
practices can be run with the same mentality as the Elementary level but with
more in depth and intermediate level skill work. For programs that are
developed with multiple teams you now have the option to really break the
practice into groups based on skill. It is still really important at this age
to be running drills that focus a lot on teamwork and sportsmanship especially
as the kids start to get more competitive and obtain egos.  
  
On to planning, as a teacher I take every moment as a teaching opportunity
even if the kids don’t know it. Start off with a proper warm up, jog, stretch,
some beginning plyos. Teach them good habits for when they are old because at
the rate they are going they may not be playing past 25. From there it is
great to start with throwing because all players at this age especially need
it and it’s a great time to get your one on one in with the kids. Move on to
your first drill of the day, a nice warm up with some sort of game aspect to
it or challenge, even though they are older attention spans are still low. For
my older kids, 8th grade, I like to have two drills in a row come next
focusing on the theme of that days practice, the first breaking down the skill
and the second being an application of that skill in a real time situation. I
always like to end practice with a full scrimmage, they deserve it and really
these kids just need to play, play, play, have fun and learn to play as a
team.
