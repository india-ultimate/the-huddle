The best piece of advice I ever received about breaking the mark is that every
fake must be a viable throw. You need to create space in order to break the
mark; strong fakes are going to make that happen. Many defenders choose to
watch only the disc when they are marking (don't do that, defenders!) and
therefore they are reacting to your fakes. By making realistic fakes, with the
disc and your upper body movement, you will get your defender to shift their
weight and be off-balance for a moment. That will create the space you need to
break your mark.  
  
This means not having two hands on the disc, which for newer players can be
uncomfortable. You cannot throw the disc with two hands, so you should not be
faking with two hands.  
  
It also means faking at different levels. If you like to throw low, then you
need to throw some high fakes to move the defenders hands up.  
  
In addition, it means learning to throw multiple fakes on one side, either the
forehand or backhand. It takes too much time when you simply pivot back and
forth, and there is nothing wrong with throwing more than one fake on a side.  
  
The bottom line is that your movements with the disc in your hand should have
a purpose and be realistic. This will force your defender to be off-balance
and will create the space you need to break the mark.
