In our first Issue of 2009, we wanted to explore one of the first
concepts that every players learns: breaking the mark. Modern defenses
rely on the mark to limit the available field space for the thrower.
Great players can escape those limitations. How do they do it?

If you want to score consistently against solid defense, your team must
be able to break the mark. While set plays and cutters can help out, at
some level the offensive player must use their fakes, throws and arsenal
of tricks to break down an individual defender.

We asked out authors the following leading questions, and we see a wide
variety among the twelve responses:

-   What is your favorite "move" for breaking the mark? How do you do
    it, and in what situations do you find it most useful?  
-   What is most important in teaching young players to break the mark?
     
-   Which do you feel is more important: Having a lot of players that
    can break the mark, or having some players on the field that can
    break the mark very well?
