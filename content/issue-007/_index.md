In this issue of The Huddle we asked our roster of authors to discuss
zone defense.

In particular we asked them to describe their favorite zone—the one they
feel the most confident in and the one they like the most—and tell us
its strengths and weaknesses. What are the holes in the D, and what are
the toughest points in the D for the offense to get around?

We also asked our authors to talk about the sort of blocks and turnovers
they expect to come out of throwing these zones.

Finally, we asked what sort of adjustments you make to the zone
point-to-point as the offense adapts. And in the same vein, which single
player in the zone set would be the most important to talk to?
