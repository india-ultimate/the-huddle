You are in an elimination game against a very strong defensive team, and
as the game moves along you find that your offense is having to work
extremely hard to throw reset throws. Pressure seems to be increasing
with every possession.

You\'ve had some sketchy moments and your handlers have had to make some
nice catches to save what would have otherwise been sure turnovers.
Stall counts, in general, are higher than you would like by the time the
dump is actually thrown. You\'ve also had one end-zone turnover when the
dump cut upfield, and faked out the thrower.

In this situation, how do you get your reset handlers to work more
effectively? Our authors give you their opinions in this issue of \"The
Huddle.\"
