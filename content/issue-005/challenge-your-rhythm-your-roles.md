Three thoughts.  
  
First, this is just the way high pressure games are. As the stakes increase,
the defense ratchets up and the offense needs to ratchet up accordingly. How
do you do this? Be mentally strong. The best path to this kind of mental
fortitude is playing in and winning these games. The second best path (and the
one reserved for those not on championship teams) is practicing all out. You
play how you practice, so if you challenge yourself and your teammates every
practice, you gameday performance will be correspondingly superior.  
  
The first technical adjustment is to change rhythm. Are you a dump-on-6 team?
Start throwing some of your resets on 1, 2, 3 in the stall count. Good
defensive teams and players run a clock in their heads. If your team is
predictable about when it throws its resets, you are effectively telling the
defenders when you are gong to cut. You don't have to throw but a few off-
rhythm passes to get an edge on the defense. Throw a couple swings on stalling
2 and then your fake on stalling 2 gets the defender biting and guessing.  
  
The second adjustment is to bring your bigs into the handler set on stalling 7
or 8 for an emergency reset. Instead of throwing to a dancing and scrambling
handler, have your bigs continue their cuts down into the hole for a two or
three yard flip to reset the stall count. Then the big hits the handler with
the swing on stalling 1 or 2 (see above). Both Sockeye (CK and MC) and Furious
(Lugs and MG) use this technique consistently and effectively.
