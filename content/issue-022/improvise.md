In game two of this year's Eastern Conference Finals against the Orlando
Magic, LeBron and the Cavs had a set play. They were down by 2 with seconds
left and needed a quick bucket. LeBron was to cut hard to the hoop for an
alley-oop. Magic forward Hedo Turkoglu had an idea what would happen and
positioned himself between LeBron and the basket. As the play unfolded, LeBron
took a few steps towards the rim, and Turkoglu sags off him. So LeBron changes
course, v-cuts back to the arch, and drains a (ridiculous) game-ending three
pointer.  
  
Winston Churchill once said: "Planning is essential, plans are useless."
LeBron had a good plan, but he noticed instinctually that his odds of
succeeding would be better if he changed course. In Ultimate, like basketball
& other sports, set plays are useful to designate a cutting order and give the
thrower a good idea of how the field will unfold. I find them especially
useful near the endzone, where the offense only needs to complete one short
pass and individual cutters do not have much space to improvise in. At the
same time, plays are guidelines, and smart players will always throw out the
plan and capitalize when the defense presents them with good opportunities.
