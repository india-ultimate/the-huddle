What makes a great play is if it works on the field with the players you have.
No matter the nomenclature, strategic genius, or underlying theory: what
happens on paper matters little.  
  
In general, I would say most team's playbooks (and plays) are too complicated.
Go simple. And a few simple rules are:  
  
**1.** Does the play work? (Not, "it would have worked if...")  
  
**2.** What is option B if the first pass doesn't go as designed? Assuming
first pass works, options for second and third passes get tricky. Be careful
with being too prescriptive.  
  
**3.** What do you do when the opponent defends the play perfectly?  
  
Often it is dealing with number three that is player dependent. Your best
handler or your smart role player whose been at every practice may bail things
out if no one else recognizes what is happening, but that often puts you in a
defensive position, re-grouping to get your O cranked up again. How well (and
how quickly) you go from the plan not working out at all to something that
puts pressure on the opposition is something you hope to get to with a set
play, and your O in general. To practice that, just tell the D what's coming.  
  
All this said, commit to a few plays and get them down as a team. Run them
over and over at some tourney. If later they don;t work as well they will at
the very least help you probe out how another team plays you or give you a
framework from which to adjust.
