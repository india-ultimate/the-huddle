In ultimate, good offense beats good defense. Defense becomes especially
difficult when the opponent has a dynamic player that is both a threat with
the disc and down field. Down 8-6 at the half our defensive goal is to make
the opponents offense, and most importantly this dynamic player,
uncomfortable. We can do this with both team and individual defensive tactics.  
  
**Suggested Team Tactics**

  * **Zone Defense:** Makes the offense complete many throws to score.
  * **Box-and-One Defense:** A great way to get an offense that relies heavily on one player off-balance. Also does a good job of frustrating a player that likes to touch the disc often.
  * **Sandwich Star Player On Stop Disc:** Force a secondary player to get the disc underneath to start their offense.

  
**Suggested Individual Tactics**

  * **Switch Match Ups On Star Player:** Alternate a tall player that encourages the player to cut under and provides a wide, intimidating mark with the quickest, fastest, high energy defender to pester the player.
  * **Make The Star Player Work On Defense:** Some offensive studs don't enjoy playing defense. Make sure once you get the turn that you run him ragged.
  * **Push The Star Under:** Since the star player has scored deep a couple times force him under, but mark him straight up to force him to settle for the little throws.
