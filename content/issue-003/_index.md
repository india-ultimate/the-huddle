Here's the situation we presented to the panel: 

You are in an elimination game against a team you have played several
times this year. They have a very skilled deep thrower that typically
plays as a handler, rarely going downfield. This player has hurt your
team in the past by throwing long goals, regardless of the type of mark
you use. Your scouting report coming in is simple: push this player deep
and keep them away from the disc.  At halftime, this player has
unusually already gone deep, successfully, 3 times. Once was on a called
pull play. They have hucked for another goal, though not on a pull play.
You are behind 8-6. What do you do in the second half? Should you
continue to push this player away from the disc? What kind of defender,
given your normal options (you can't just put World's Greatest Defender
on them) should be used?
