It's too bad you can't put the World's Greatest Defender on this person,
because they sound like they are the World's Best Offensive Player.  
  
I would probably get two defenders to alternate defensive points with the
intention of solely guarding this person. Ideally, one defender would be the
quick/squirrelly type with a good mark to challenge him around the disc and
apply pressure on the mark. The second defender would be fast and preferably
able to out-jump this person, with the intention of continuing to push him
deep (but maybe not quite as much as in the first half). The idea behind two
defenders with two different objectives is to keep this offensive person off
balance. Requiring a person to constantly switch roles in order to be
effective is preferable to letting them stay in whatever zone they are in.  
  
Starting the second half, have the quick marker start out (because the
offender is already in a groove going deep), and unless they are wildly
successful (i.e. handblock), switch defenders the next O point. If a couple
cycles of that doesn't work, there's always zone until half-field.
