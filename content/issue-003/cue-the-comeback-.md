Well...the answer to a situation like this (defending a handler in the lanes)
is going to be dependant on a number of factors and variables that are unknown
in this scenario (athletic ability, height, speed, etc.). However, in a
general sense, if you have one of the main players on the opposing team
drastically altering their game due to your defensive strategy then your
defensive strategy is effective. Forcing a "main handler" to strike and cut
downfield is a great situation for the defensive team. This means that the
handler is not quarterbacking the offence, and they are potentially getting in
the way of the primary lane cutters.  
  
As such, I would not be concerned at all if the handler was in the lanes and
has made a couple of lucky catches. Can they continue to do it for the rest of
the game? Can the offence continue to convert at a high rate with secondary
players running the show and making the big throws? I doubt it and odds are
good that a comeback will be on in the second half.  
  
As far as defender choiceâ€”I would always choose a taller more athletic
defender on a strong handler. On our team we have had very good success with
Andrew Lugsdin marking up against all-star handlers. His agility allows him to
be able to stay with the short quick cuts and his size helps him to play
underneath and "push the handler away from the disc."
