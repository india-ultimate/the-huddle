In every sport (save cycling and aquatics) there is an element of
footwork that goes into the skills and techniques that an athlete
develops. In baseball it is the timing of a batter waiting for a pitch.
In football, it is the cornerback pedaling backwards, shuffling
sideways, sprinting all-out, and the transitions in between.

In Ultimate footwork has become more and more of a priority for
individual players at the elite level. Efficiencies with your legs on
defense can mean the difference between getting a block and giving up an
easy goal. Being able to effectively pivot with the disc in your hands
can mean getting a throw off before stall 10.

In this issue of \"The Huddle,\" we have asked our authors to discuss
examples of good footwork on the field and what we can do to improve,
illustrate who they have seen that demonstrates superior skills in this
manner, and show us what may be some telltale signs of poor form.
