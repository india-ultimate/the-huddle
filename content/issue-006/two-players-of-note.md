Two players that come to mind when I think of good footwork are Idris Nolan
offensively and Hensley Sejour defensively. Idris is quite a good basketball
player, which requires a significant amount of body control as well as
footwork. Hensley, coming from a football background as a defensive back (I
believe) has worked on his footwork extensively.  
  
Whether offensively or defensively, Idris and Hensley have the same traits in
common:  
  
**1\. Awareness of the current situation.**  
Each player understands where the disc is on the field. Knowing where the disc
is on the field allows you to position yourself to make a play. They are also
keenly aware of the type of player that is opposite of them and are able to
identify their strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, they are aware of they
player who has the disc.  
  
**2\. Positioning themselves.**  
Using the knowledge from assessing the situation, they position themselves to
make a play. Offensively this could be repositioning yourself to a location
that will make the next throw easier, or closing the distance between
themselves and the defender. From a defensive standpoint, it could be as
simple as taking an extra half step toward the disc, or a step to the break
side.  
  
**3\. Making people commit.**  
Offensively, Idris is great at making people commit one way and changing his
direction. I think that comes quite a bit from playing basketball and trying
to get people off balance. Defensively, Hensley will position himself so that
the offensive player only has one cut. However, with the footwork of a
defensive back, if he is feinted, he is able to recover quickly without
tripping over himself.  
  
Their awareness, positioning, and footwork to make people commit or recover
allow them to make plays on offense and defense.  
  
Over the past two years, our teams have started to implement footwork drills
during track sessions. Most of the footwork drills are ladder drills at this
time. Our workouts in sprinting have incorporated some footwork drills, but
usually the focus is on Ultimate specific type of sprints. Everyone on our
team has noticed that their footwork in Ultimate is better from even doing
something simple as ladder drills.  
  
I think the Ultimate community is very slowly coming to the realization that
there is a proper way of doing things, but have yet to make the change. Mostly
because there has not been an authority figure to say this is the right way to
do something. For instance, we may do some defensive drills, but each player
executes their footwork as they know how and are unwilling to change because
they have been successful in the past even with poor footwork.  
  
This will change in the future, as I see the implementation of soccer and
defensive back football type drills into ultimate, as players start to make
the association between the footwork in those two sports and Ultimate. This
implementation will have to come from players who are/were low level college
players who have practiced the footwork and know the drills that work to
improve footwork. With few exceptions, we are not there quite yet...but we
will be shortly.
