Three points about zone offense that are usually true:

  1. Your poppers have to identify the zone they are playing against and adjust their positioning/movement accordingly. Handlers must do the same and adjust their throws.  

  2. Keep moving. It's easy for deeps and wings to start standing and watching. Even if your zone offense calls for you as the deep O threat to go to the back of the endzone, move around there.  
  
Let the deeps on D see you moving. You don't have to sprint, but you can't
stand. Zone defenders want to keep track of what's going on. Give them more to
keep track of.  
  

  3. Never throw to someone backpedaling and don't turn your back to the play. For some players this will seem obvious, but lots of people playing zone O do both.
