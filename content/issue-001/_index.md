Horizontal stack offenses have become much more popular in the last
decade at the expense of the previously ubiquitous vertical stack
offense. Given equivalent talent, which type offense would you rather
run in windy situations?

This question is one that captains and coaches struggle with each year,
and is even more pressing at the club level, where October weather and
Florida hurricanes put a premium on moving the disc into the wind. Not
long ago, the Condors won a championship in a game with a single upwind
point.

To guide our panel, we asked the following sub-questions as well:

-   Which offense works better into the wind? With a strong downwind?
    What about a stiff crosswind? Â 
-   What adjustments can you make strategically in either offense in a
    very strong (sustained 20-mph +) wind?
