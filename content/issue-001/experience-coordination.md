To my eyes, the advantage of the spread/horizontal is that you don't need a
whole group of people working together, but can be effective by working in
just pairs of upfield cutters or on occasion an isolated receiver. Of course,
the better teams will have coordination of all the players, but for a young
team, or a team using a new system, things can get up and running effectively
with the horizontal.

To the question as which is more effective in windy situations, again I think
you have to look at not the ability of the team, but their familiarity with
one another and the system they are using. If a team has a lot of experience
working together in a vertical stack system, I think they will make
adjustments in the wind that will be very effective. Similar for a horizontal
stack, the difference would be in a pickup team, or a team without a lot of
practice together, I think the adjustments in a horizontal system are easier
to describe and implement for windy conditions than for a vertical system.
