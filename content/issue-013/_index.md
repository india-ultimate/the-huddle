Young, athletic, inexperienced players can be taught 1-on-1 defense, at
least at a cursory level, very quickly. "Stay close to your person" or
"run hard, get your hand on the disc" work very well for simple
defensive skills.

However, team defense (poaching, switching, zone) can be harder to
teach, which is probably why so few players are really good at these
skills. In a search for insight on this topic, we asked our authors the
following questions:

-   Have you had success teaching team defense to a team?
-   What did you teach? How did you go about it? Were there specific
    drills that you did that helped players learn?
-   Are there specific team defense attributes that you have found
    particularly difficult to teach?
