Here are my six recommendations to anyone who is trying out for a team of any
level:  
  
**1.** Be on time and have all of the appropriate equipment for the tryout.  
  
**2.** Relax — tryouts are a high stress process for everyone involved, but as
a captain/coach I'm looking to see how players handle themselves throughout
the process. Tryouts are a decent representation of how players will handle
high-stress situations during tournaments.  
  
**3.** Know what you can and can't do — Before you even get to the tryout
think about your game, what throws you are confident in, how you have been
taught to mark, what assets you think you can bring to the table. Also, remind
yourself what you aren't so great at. At the tryout put yourself in situations
in which you are likely to succeed. Show off what you can do. Conversely,
don't try to do too much. If you don't have a deep flick, don't try it. Throw
a good fake if someone is open deep for your flick and make a smart throw
underneath.  
  
**4.** Go for it! Again, this is your chance to show what you can do, if a
play you can make presents itself go do it, and do it with confidence!  
  
**5.** Hustle! A coach will always find a spot for someone that is willing to
work hard.  
  
**6.** Show you are coachable — If a coach suggests something to you, listen,
and try to apply the suggestion in the scrimmage.
