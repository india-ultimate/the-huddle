Spring brings the climax of the college season, as well as the beginning
of club. Most club teams hold some sort of tryout; without adding new
talent they are sure to fall off of the map sooner rather than later.

At this point in the year, thousands of ambitious players are cleating
up to show that they are worth a precious roster spot. We asked our
panel to give us their thoughts on the tryout process in general. Their
answers demonstrate the complex nature of tryouts, both from the
tryout\'s perspective as well as from the viewpoint of the
decision-makers.

If you are trying out for a team, or even if you are interested in how
captains of various teams approach their tryout process\...keep reading.
The responses show a commitment to improving each team, but in a variety
of different ways.

Below are several of the sub-questions we asked to provide structure for
the panel\'s answers:

-   Do young players have any chance of making the team as an offensive
    player? What about as a handler? As a hucker? What would they have
    to show you to prove their worth?  
-   Is calm, conservative play better? Or do you want to see highlight
    reel moves, throws, and catches?  
-   Say you are a young player with a specialty throw (something out of
    the normal repetoire). You are confident in that throw, but it
    doesn\'t really fit easily into a team\'s offense (rather, they
    could change how they play to take advantage of this talent).  
-   Should you show this in tryout scrimmages?  
-   What is most important: practices or tournaments?  
-   How should tryouts behave and carry themselves? Some captains and
    coaches love people that ask a ton of questions, and others want
    people that want a lot of feedback. Or give their opinions. Or are
    silent, strong teammates. What are you looking for? Does the
    personality of a player figure large into whether they can make the
    team? What about an obnoxious player with tremendous talent?  
-   Is there anything about the tryout process that you think teams
    should do more often?  
-   Does everyone try out, or are returning players safe?  
-   How long are your tryouts? Is this optimal?
