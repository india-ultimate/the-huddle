You have to ask yourself, "What do I do that is great?" This is your ticket
onto a team. For most young players, this is blue-collar Ultimate: tough D,
swing passes and safe choices. If what you have to offer is something
different (big throws, great recievership), then showcase those skills.  
  
The two quickest ways to get yourself cut are poor atheleticism (nothing much
to be done about that) and poor choices with the disc. A lot of tryouts get in
trouble by failing to recognize that the definition of a good choice has
changed. A good choice for Eastern Wyoming State (Go Fighting Pronghorns!) is
a piss-poor choice for Bravo. Aim for zero turns. I mean zero.
