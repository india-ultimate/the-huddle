*(This past week for the first birthday of The Huddle, Kirk Savage got
us a present\...Al Nichols\' article about layout blocks. Kind of like
reading about \'Playing well in the 4th quarter\" by Larry Bird. Thanks
to everyone that has supported us all year!)*

You\'ve trained, you\'ve watched film, and you know your opponent. Maybe
you\'ve been waiting all game, all season, or your entire Ultimate life
to take a layout block from that player in a big game. Like hitting a
walk-off home-run. Like marching around your hometown with the Stanley
Cup in your Radio Flyer.Â 

Many mediocre players spent many hours visualizing these outcomes. The
best defenders, though, try to understand the process that can get you
to that block. How should you plan to create block opportunities? Where
should your feet be? Your core? Your arms?

Your mind?

We asked our authors how they play this situation, and how they think
about it themselves both as a player and a coach. Enjoy\....and then go
get some of your own!
