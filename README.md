[The Huddle](http://the-huddle.org/), created by Ben Wiggins and Andy Lovseth,
was an incredible resource while it existed, presenting a wealth of high-level
information that is still extremely useful and relevant.

This web-site is an archive of The Huddle that intends to make the contents
easier to search and prettier to read. This archive has been generated from
another archive available at the [USA Ultimate
website](https://www.usaultimate.org/huddle/issue001.aspx), which is a little
hard to read and navigate, especially on mobile devices.

This archive is maintained by [@punchagan](https://github.com/punchagan/). You
