intends to make the site faster to use and prettier to read.

This archive has been generated from another archive available at the [USA
Ultimate website](https://www.usaultimate.org/huddle/issue001.aspx), which is a
little hard to read and navigate, especially on mobile devices.

This archive is maintained by [@punchagan](https://github.com/punchagan/). You
