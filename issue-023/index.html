    <h4><a href="https://the-huddle.indiaultimate.org/issue-023/avoid-the-pile-up/" itemprop="headline">Avoid The Pile-Up</a></h4>
    
        <p><a href="/author/ray-illian/">Ray Illian</a></p>
    
    <p>We&rsquo;ve all been there before. The throw goes up, the disc catches some wind,
and just hangs. As the intended offensive receiver, you are forced to slow
down and track the path of the disc. It soon becomes quite crowded around you
as multiple players converge on what seems like the optimal position to vie
for the disc. Soon it&rsquo;s time to jump for the disc and hope everything works
out. If you can maneuver through the tangled mess of limbs and actually extend
your arm(s) into the air unfettered and catch the disc, then pat yourself on
the back. You completed a low percentage catch, and the thrower owes you a
burrito/sandwich at the next team dinner.</p>
<p>For the rest of us who aren&rsquo;t Alex Nord or Brodie Smith, our best chances of
catching the disc arise from exploiting the weaknesses of the pile-up. The
first of which is a speed mismatch. Crowds of people vying for the same
position are usually moving pretty slow. Take advantage of this and always be
moving faster than the crowd when you prepare to jump for the disc. Sprint
towards the pile, take the extra long step to lower your center of gravity
(and load your calves like a spring), and use the extra space around you to
translate your horizontal momentum into vertical momentum by propelling your
off-jumping leg and catching arm upwards in one motion. This could very well
give you the extra inch or two you need to sky the pile, as those trapped in
the pile are usually unable to jump at their maximum height.</p>
<p>Another weakness for those in the pile-up is perspective. The farther away you
are from the crowd, the better your grasp of the situation becomes: You have a
more complete view of the path of the disc and the movement of other players
which gives you a better idea of where the disc will end up. This information
can help you take the best course of action, whether it&rsquo;s trying to sky the
pile, realizing the pile has the wrong read on the disc and beating them to
the right spot unobstructed, or strategically positioning yourself to pick up
the trash after a deflection (which is more likely than the disc being
caught).</p>
<p>Truth be told, the intended receiver rarely is the one to win these 50/50 type
scenarios. Rather, it&rsquo;s the heads-up offensive player on the other end of the
fieldâ€”surveying the situation and acting accordingly at 100% - who is going to
come down with the disc. Avoid the pile-up.</p>

        <p><a href="/author/brett-matzuka/">Brett Matzuka</a></p>
    
    <p>Usually being the shortest guy on the teams I play on, catching 50/50 (jump
ball) discs from my perspective is a different game altogether. There are two
situations you can encounter with a 50/50 disc. Either you are in the eye of
the storm, in which case you were the initial receiver or your the first
defender to get into the play, and a multitude of others are collapsing down
upon you from all places.</p>
<p>This case is the hard one for people of my stature as you will get caught up
in a group of people obviously taller than you. In this case, there are a few
steps you can take to maximize your chances of getting a play on the disc.</p>
<p>The two most important parts to me can be summed up with: play smart, play
tall.</p>
<p>Play smart just means don&rsquo;t try and out jump or play a game of 500 with a
group of people who already have a huge advantage in height. Instead of
attempting to sky Shaq, try and get to the position where you believe the disc
will first be playable. This is especially important as most packs of people
are rarely in the spot the disc will first be playable, but will stumble there
as the disc floats by. This is your chance to take advantage of all those
trying to battle for immediate position on one another to get a good chance to
get into position for the disc. Getting in position for the disc is defined as
getting to the point which maximizes your personal chance of making a play on
the disc, while getting position on an opponent is defined as getting in a
position to minimize your opponents chance of making a play on the disc.</p>
<p>Defensively, this second definition is important since for someone short like
myself, you can lure your opposition out of his best position to make a play
on the disc to a less advantageous position; this may not immediately benefit
you in terms of making a play yourself, but it does cut their chances of
receiving the pass which is realistically your real objective on defense. For
our sake, we will be trying to catch the disc at all times. With that, once
you have got to a position you believe is best for you to play the disc, next
it is time to play tall.</p>
<p>For someone like me, this means one simple thing: Go up early! Like I said
before, you are not going to sky Shaq, but you can catch him off guard before
he begins to make a play. If you go up early, not just will that give you a
better chance, but it also will increase your chances of getting fouled. A
taller guy thinks he can take another second to set up as he already has the
height advantage. By going up early, you have already established your
position in the air. If the opponent then jumps later and into you, there is a
decent chance his contact will result in a foul which results in your
possession. Since this is your overall goal, taking any advantage to
accomplish it is worthwhile.</p>
<p>The second case that comes up is the group has already formed and you are
running in to join the pack. In this case, being my height, it isn&rsquo;t about
joining the giants as much as predicting the final outcome. Most likely, the
disc will get mac&rsquo;d (mac = mid air correction) around, and your job is to
predict where it is to finally finish its flight. This is more advantageous
than joining the pack because 1. you will probably not be able to follow the
steps from case one which is probably your only chance of realistically having
a play, 2. because jumping from outside the pack into it almost always results
in a foul whether you accept it or not, and 3. the best outcome personally
from your position is being the scrapper.</p>
<p>So, for this second case, instead of joining the mayhem, read the disc flight
pattern, the wind, the group and try and place yourself outside the pack in a
place the disc most likely will finish if no one explicitly catches it. This
sounds easy enough, and it is, but you will be surprised at how many times a
few players join a pack with no realistic shot at receiving the disc just to
watch as it gets mac&rsquo;d to where they were before they decided to jump in. If
you watched Rhino&rsquo;s highlight videos from Regionals 2 years ago, they got 3-4
completions/goals by having players stand outside the pack and make plays on
the scraps after large numbers of big men mac&rsquo;d it.</p>
<p>All in all, when the disc goes up and you think you can make a play, whether
you are the intended receiver or the dump for that throw that jump went up,
put everything you can into making it a completion. Whether it is a complete
jump ball, or a one on one contest, if you play smart and play tall, you will
surely come down with more discs than before.</p>

    <h4><a href="https://the-huddle.indiaultimate.org/issue-023/catching-priorities/" itemprop="headline">Catching Priorities</a></h4>
    
        <p><a href="/author/lindsey-hack/">Lindsey Hack</a></p>
    
    <p>In order to catch a 50/50 disc a player needs to be able to do a number of
things correctly to win the battle.</p>
<p><strong>1. Reading</strong><br>
The player must be able to read the disc and understand how the wind and the
way the disc was thrown is going to affect its flight path.</p>
<p><strong>2. Positioning</strong><br>
Once that player has a good grasp of where that disc is going to float down to
earth, that player must establish that position firmly. This, establishing and
maintaining your position, does take strength, and if a player thinks that
they can continue to compete at high levels without weight training, they are
out of their minds.</p>
<p><strong>3. Jump</strong><br>
The player must be able to jump higher than the other people in this group who
are also trying to do #1 and #2. If you do number one and number two
perfectly, but do not have as high of a vertical as someone else in this
cluster, there is still a chance you will come down with that disc. If you
want to ensure that it is you that is going to catch that disc, get yourself
on a plyometric program and increase your vertical. With jumping also comes
<strong>timing your jump</strong>. Timing your jump is also a skill that can be worked on.
Every time you go tossing, practice timing your catch with reaching the peak
of your vertical. he more you are able to catch discs at the peak of your
vertical in practice, the more likely you will be able to do this in a game
situation. This takes timing and knowing when the disc is at the right height
for you.</p>
<p><strong>4. Catching The Disc</strong><br>
You have read the disc right, you got the position, you can jump higher than
anyone else, and you have perfect timing on your jump. Now, catch that piece
of plastic! Snatch it out of the air! Grab it! Do not gently try to pull it
out of the air. Catch with authority. Practice catching with one hand.
Practice catching with your left. Practice catching with your right. Practice
catching. Do not let yourself casually drop it even when tossing. Remember,
perfect practice makes perfect.</p>

    <h4><a href="https://the-huddle.indiaultimate.org/issue-023/getting-the-advantage/" itemprop="headline">Getting The Advantage</a></h4>
    
        <p><a href="/author/kurt-gibson/">Kurt Gibson</a></p>
    
    <p>Catching a 50/50 disc is not an exact science just like every other aspect of
Ultimate and unfortunately there aren&rsquo;t a lot of aspects you can practice if
you&rsquo;re looking to sky the best receivers in the game. Superior athleticism and
your ability to read the disc almost always win. However, there are a few
things (besides improving vertical leap, experience, etc.) that can set you
apart from the rest of the pack if you want to have an advantage at catching a
disc over someone of similar or greater ability.</p>
<p>The first thing may seem obvious but you won&rsquo;t believe how many of the best
receivers in the game have a preferred hand to catch with, and/or will always
catch with the same hand in a big moment. As an elite receiver you should be
100% confident with either hand at any moment during the game.</p>
<p>The second is body position. As an offender on a 50/50 disc you need to be
able to anticipate where the disc is going to be where you can catch it at
your highest because you have to assume that with two or three other defenders
on you, someone will be at least as good a jumper/reader as you are. As soon
as the huck goes up you have to get yourself to where you can make a bid for
the disc at the peak of your jump without letting the other defenders get
position. You have to get to the spot where you will catch the disc at its
peak regardless of where the defenders go around you. Don&rsquo;t let the defense
dictate where you can position yourself.</p>
<p>The last important aspect of catching a 50/50 disc is the drop step. Again,
even many of the best receivers have a preference of which foot they jump off.
It is very important to be able to drop step/jump off both feet. ou never know
when you need to go off your right foot and catch with your left hand or vice
versa to be at your highest point depending on where your defender(s) are.</p>
<p>An example where you can win a 50/50 using all of these skills. Let&rsquo;s say you
and two other defenders are all running underneath a moving disc and all of
you are 5'10 and can catch a disc at 10ft in the air. The disc is hovering at
11 ft and as an offender you need to come down with this disc. The disc is
bobbing up and down and is about to come into the 10ft range so everyone drop
steps and prepares to jump, however, you and the other defender see as you do
that that the disc bobs right back up. One defender goes up too early. That
leaves you and one other defender. As soon as the defender missed the disc it
starts to come back down close to the ten foot range. Because you can jump off
both legs you only have to take three strides to drop step again and jump off
your other foot. The defender has to take four strides and jump off the same
foot. You jump first and go up with the hand opposite the leg you jumped off
of and catch the disc because you can catch/jump confidently with both
legs/feet. The first defender was only confident in jumping/catching off one
foot/hand and he also gave up body position by jumping early. The second
defender couldn&rsquo;t jump off the other foot confidently leaving him one stride
behind you despite maintaining position.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve just saved your team a turnover and possibly the game if you can catch
with both hands confidently, jump of both feet confidently, and maintain
establish position first.</p>

    <h4><a href="https://the-huddle.indiaultimate.org/issue-023/how-to-get-into-the-sky-club/" itemprop="headline">How To Get Into The Sky Club</a></h4>
    
        <p><a href="/author/kiran-thomas/">Kiran Thomas</a></p>
    
    <p>My first action, after recognizing that I am about to engage in a 50/50 disc
tango, is to take the appropriate angle of attack based on where I think the
disc is going to go. This is obviously stale information for veterans. But for
the beginners out there, you&rsquo;ll always be considered a member of the grounds
crew if you keep running directly underneath the disc expecting that it will
drop down to you. Being able to understand the disc&rsquo;s angle of descent with
ease will put you on the fast track to a Sky Club membership.</p>
<p>The next step for me is to try and visualize the best course of action I need
to take to get the disc in my hand. I&rsquo;ll have images running through my head
that guide me through the upcoming attack. Do I see myself needing to shield
off my defender(s)? Should I accelerate/decelerate to the disc? The goal for
me is to be proactive about what I need to do instead of being reactive.
During this process, the disc and its trajectory will hopefully position
itself in in a way that looks familiar to what I have been preparing for.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve described this moment to teammates by saying the disc looks fatter to me.
I have no logical explanation as to why the disc looks fatter. Maybe it will
look like a cheeseburger to you if you try this, I don&rsquo;t know. All I know is I
have a visual trigger that tells me it&rsquo;s time to execute.</p>
<p>Personally, the ability to visualize how to attack a floaty disc mid-flight
comes from practice. I have practiced pulling down high discs hundreds of
times (and counting) against a plethora of leapers in Austin and against my
soccer player of a younger brother (always good for confidence building). In a
game, I know I can take the time to relax and visualize while the disc is in
the air because I am comfortable in this situation. I am confident of when to
attack, because I have practiced it many times before.</p>
<p>One last thing I would like to add is that I think a common mistake in the
50/50 situation is to worry about how high your competitors can jump. If you
freak yourself out about whom you are up against, you are setting yourself up
for failure. Be confident in what you can do and let the other person(s) do
the worrying.</p>

    <h4><a href="https://the-huddle.indiaultimate.org/issue-023/make-them-make-a-play/" itemprop="headline">Make Them Make A Play</a></h4>
    
        <p><a href="/author/morgan-hibbert/">Morgan Hibbert</a></p>
    
    <p>When it comes to catching a floating 50/50 disc, one of the most important
things to think about is that if the other person is going to get the disc
then at least make them make a play. Force them to make a great play to catch
it, don&rsquo;t let it be easy. This philosophy most directly applies to playing
defence, but still applies to offensive situations.</p>
<p>Too often I see players setting up position behind their opposition. As a
shorter player going up against a taller player this is especially
detrimental. As soon as you set up shop behind someone you are giving them the
advantage. They now have the first shot at making the catch. You will only
catch it if they jump and miss it. You&rsquo;ve given them superior positioning and
they won&rsquo;t feel much pressure from your presence as they are in front with a
clear line of sight to the disc and nothing in their way preventing them from
making the catch.</p>
<p>Establishing inside position is the first step towards winning the sky battle.
Again, if you are shorter than your opponent this is imperative. By
establishing inside position you now have a chance to control the situation.
You have a better opportunity to find the spot on the field where you can
catch the disc at the peak of your jump. If you do this it means the player
behind you (who might be taller) has to jump up and reach over you (forward)
in order to catch the disc. This is a lot more challenging for them as they
have to reach further out than originally desired, and mentally have to worry
about you whilst at the same time trying to focus on catching the disc. If
they&rsquo;re four inches taller than you they may still catch the disc, but at
least it was tougher than it would have been otherwise and <strong>you have made
them make a play</strong>. However, it is possible you have given them too much to
think about and they drop the disc or jump too early and miss it entirely.</p>
<p>Again, this strategy most directly applies to playing defence on 50/50 discs
as when no one catches it you still win. However, this equally applies to
offense as it is always easier to catch a disc when no one is in your way
rather than having to jump over someone. Your opponent doesn&rsquo;t know what kind
of hops you have and getting inside position gives you that little bit of an
advantage you need and gives your opponent a few more things to think about
when calculating their attack.</p>
<p>For an analogy to other sports, try watching basketball players as they
establish themselves to retrieve a rebound. They expel the majority of their
effort getting to the right spot on the floor in front of everyone else. Once
there the rebound is theirs following an easy jump.</p>

    <h4><a href="https://the-huddle.indiaultimate.org/issue-023/positioning-approach/" itemprop="headline">Positioning &amp; Approach</a></h4>
    
        <p><a href="/author/greg-husak/">Greg Husak</a></p>
    
    <p>While we call these hangers &ldquo;50/50 discs,&rdquo; I would bet that at the moment the
disc is coming down an observer would have a better than coin-flip chance of
guessing who will touch the disc first. Keying in on the information informing
that decision will help guide a player in giving themselves a better than
coin-flip chance of getting to it first.</p>
<p>I think that beyond obvious physical differences (&ldquo;I like the guy who is 6'8&rdquo;
over the short guy&quot;) the two main components are positioning and approach. If
you&rsquo;re at the spot early you may want to position yourself so that someone
else approaching on a dead run isn&rsquo;t going to be able to have a clean takeoff
and take it at their highest point. This doesn&rsquo;t mean you are not playing the
disc, but it does mean that you are going to play the disc in a way that
allows you to reduce your opponent&rsquo;s chance of taking it at a higher point
than you.</p>
<p>Related to this is the approach. If there are three people standing still
under the disc and one guy is coming in with a clean running jump, I like the
guy on the outside. This means that if you are going to be the third or fourth
man in the pile, it might be better to hold up for a second and try to time it
so you jump over the group. This is easier said than done, but we&rsquo;ve all seen
pictures of people getting roofed because they&rsquo;re stuck standing still while
another guy had a clean jumping approach.</p>

        <p><a href="/author/miranda-roth/">Miranda Roth</a></p>
    
    <p>To catch a 50/50 disc, you need to somehow make the chances better than 50/50
for yourself. The first thing you can do is be tallâ€”and yes, I know you can&rsquo;t
teach height, but this also includes putting your hand up outstretched and
trying to catch the disc at your &ldquo;tallest point&rdquo; including your jump. This is
related to the second thing which is timing your jump. I know lots of players
(particularly new women) who think just putting their hand up will workâ€”well,
it won&rsquo;t work against good competition. To know when to jump you need to
practice jumping and catching as high as you possibly canâ€”playing flyers-
up/500 and doing lots of one on one catching will help with this.</p>
<p>The third, and possibly most important thing, is to get position on as many of
the other people as you possibly can. If one of the other people is your
teammate, getting position on the opponent can actually allow your teammate to
catch the disc, too. If you can judge where the disc will come down and put
your body between that space and your opponent, you will greatly increase your
chances of catching the disc. However, you must, as I like to tell my players,
&ldquo;Retain that s***!&rdquo; This means that once you get position, you can&rsquo;t relaxâ€”you
must actively maintain your position physically.</p>
<p><strong>ADDENDUM:</strong></p>
<p>We received this email from a reader:</p>
<p><em>I read the article from Ms. Roth about the catching discs subject and I
disagree with one point. Ms. Roth wrote: &ldquo;If one of the other people is your
teammate, getting position on the opponent can actually allow your teammate to
catch the disc, too&rdquo; For me, if you don&rsquo;t play the disc you are not allowed to
block the opponent to help your teammate. I checked WFDF Rules and it is
related to rule 12.7. Keep up the good work. -a reader in France</em> <strong>The
Huddle&rsquo;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p><em>Thanks, ARIF, We (and Miranda) agree with the rule that an offensive player
cannot move solely to block a defender. For instance, if you are on defense, I
can&rsquo;t run towards you and away from my teammate just to make sure you cannot
make a play. Miranda is trying to make the point that the offense is allowed
to choose whatever method they want to make a play on the disc. If I am on
offense, and I move in a way where I could catch the disc but also is a
position that seals a defender from making a likely play, this can be both
legal and extremely effective. In practical terms, the differences between an
illegal block and a legal positioning is probably going to come down to
whether the player in question could (given flight of the disc, position, and
where the player is looking) make a catch on that particular throw. Thanks,
ARIF, for bringing this confusing issue to more clarity and we hope this makes
sense. -The Editors</em></p>

        <p><a href="/author/chase-sparling-beckley/">Chase Sparling-Beckley</a></p>
    
    <p><strong>On Offense</strong><br>
You ought to have done much of the work up front. You were out in the lane
first, making an open cut to the end zone, you were looking over your shoulder
and saw the release point of the throw. You made your read early, calculated
the trajectory of the disc, and picked your line before your defender even
heard an up call.</p>
<p>Realizing that your thrower has laid you out to dry with a floaty throw (at
least they didn&rsquo;t pump fake and make you come under), you pick a spot four to
five yards from where the disc will come down between the disc and the
defender to hold your ground. You pause, as several other defenders and Danny
Trydiak pile up near you. As the disc is just about to glide into range you
attack, with two large, powerful steps towards the spot you predicted and an
inertia-aided spring from your dominant leg. You jump, and snatch the disc
right over the top of the pile of defenders. People tangle up in your wake,
Danny springs free for the end zone, and an easy throw for a goal.</p>
<p><strong>On Defense</strong><br>
Your head was down, you were running hard to make up ground, when the up call
came. You immediately look up to see the disc, just a glance and a quick
readâ€”it is floatingâ€”and then you put your head back down and try to close the
distance between you and your mark, knowing that they have already gotten a
better look at the disc. As you close in, your mark starts to slow up a
little, you glance over your shoulder again at the disc, this time able to
make a fair judgment of where it is going to come down. Your mark ought to
have picked the best spot to be in already, a few paces from the anticipated
catch zone. You quickly do the math, &ldquo;Am I taller/wider than my opponent? If
so, I would get between them and the disc, forcing them to initiate contact on
their jump, and effectively using my girth/height advantage to box them off
the disc. No, I am shorter but jumpier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You pick a line similar to the offensive player, a few big steps laterally
from the anticipated catch zone, and pause as more offensive players and Danny
Trydiak pile up under the disc. At the right moment you spring, propelling
yourself towards the disc and then upâ€”your highest jump. At the last second,
you remind yourself, &ldquo;Be sure&rdquo; and opt to catch the D instead of macking it.
As players tangle and fall in your wake, you swing the disc wisely to Roger,
knowing that Danny will probably just huck it&hellip;.</p>
