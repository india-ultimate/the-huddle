          Breaking The Mark
        </h1>
        <p>Issue 14 &mdash; Monday, Mar 9, 2009</p>
        
    </div>
    <div class="content col col-12">
        <p>In our first Issue of 2009, we wanted to explore one of the first
concepts that every players learns: breaking the mark. Modern defenses
rely on the mark to limit the available field space for the thrower.
Great players can escape those limitations. How do they do it?</p>
<p>If you want to score consistently against solid defense, your team must
be able to break the mark. While set plays and cutters can help out, at
some level the offensive player must use their fakes, throws and arsenal
of tricks to break down an individual defender.</p>
<p>We asked out authors the following leading questions, and we see a wide
variety among the twelve responses:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is your favorite &quot;move&quot; for breaking the mark? How do you do
it, and in what situations do you find it most useful? Â </li>
<li>What is most important in teaching young players to break the mark?
Â </li>
<li>Which do you feel is more important: Having a lot of players that
can break the mark, or having some players on the field that can
break the mark very well? Â </li>
</ul>

    <h4><a href="https://the-huddle.indiaultimate.org/issue-014/-beating-the-mark/" itemprop="headline">&#34;Beating&#34; The Mark</a></h4>
    
        <p><a href="/author/adam-sigelman/">Adam Sigelman</a></p>
    
    <p>When most players think about breaking the mark, they envision a thrower
throwing around or over a stationary mark. However, I&rsquo;d argue that the
majority of break throws in high level ultimate don&rsquo;t happen this way. Most
breaks I see are simple forehands and backhands thrown in motion with the mark
trailing behind the thrower.</p>
<p>You can be a great at switching fields with the Frisbee and have terrible
&ldquo;break throws&rdquo;. Here are three keys. (Note that this scenario assumes the disc
towards the force sideline and you set up slightly behind or parallel to the
disc. However, these same principles can apply in other scenarios as well).</p>
<p><strong>1. Separation.</strong> Breaking the mark starts first with your legs. It makes
your life much easier if you can get a good few yards of separation. The
typical (but not only) move is to drive your defender a few yards up the line.
Wait until she turns her hips, plant, and then go back towards the line of
scrimmage. The defender has to respect the up-the-line cut, giving you a
chance to create separation going back towards the Frisbee.</p>
<p><strong>2. Positioning.</strong> Once you have some separation, you need to make a key
decision in a split second. It comes down to whether you want to secure the
reset or go for a break strike. Lots of factors play into this decision; the
competency of the thrower, the conditions, where the mark is standing, etc. If
you decide to secure the reset, angle your cut to make the throw easy,
regardless of how it sets up the break throw. If you like your chances on a
slightly more difficult throw to space, you want to curl your cut towards the
break side of the field. The thrower should lead you in this direction with a
somewhat floaty throw. Make sure that you put your body between the disc and
your defender. When you catch the disc, you are moving in the direction you
want to throw with the defender behind you. Getting this angle right is an art
not a science, and mastering it is key to getting this break off easily.</p>
<p><strong>3. The Release.</strong> Don&rsquo;t stop. You have two and a half steps to throw the
disc without committing a travel violation. Use these steps to maintain
separation. Throw in stride. (You may need to set a very quick pivot foot to
get off a forehand, but not necessarily with a little backhand flip.) It helps
to practice catching and throwing the disc on the run, working on making your
release as quick and accurate as possible.</p>

    <p><strong>What is your favorite &lsquo;move&rsquo; for breaking the mark? How do you do it, and in
what situations do you find it most useful?</strong></p>
<p>To break the mark, I typically like to convince, or deceive, the mark that I
am going to throw a different throw than what I want.</p>
<p>For example, if I am being forced flick and I want to throw the around
backhand break, I will get into a very threatening inside out forehand flick
position. Since my break flick gets released pretty close to my knees, or the
ground, and is on the right side of my body, typically the mark will start to
lean over towards that position. Once I have noticed that they have committed
their center of gravity to defending the break flick, I will immediately pivot
over to my backhand side and complete the throw.</p>
<p><strong>What is most important in teaching young players to break the mark?</strong></p>
<p>Younger players can afford to make more mistakes, and I truly believe you are
not going to learn how to break the mark if you never attempt to in the first
place. Therefore, I think it is most important to teach young players to just
do it and do not fret too much if it is a turnover. Whether it is a turnover
or not, I ask the younger player to reflect on their throw and recount what
made it successful/unsuccessful.</p>
<p><strong>Which do you feel is more important: Having a lot of players that can break
the mark, or having some players on the field that can break the mark very
well?</strong></p>
<p>Tough question. I think it is important to have a lot of players that can
break the mark. If everyone can break the mark somewhat, it means every cut is
dangerous whether it is to the break side or not. If half your players can not
break the mark that successfully, good defenders are going to catch on. If
that smart defender is guarding a player who can not break the mark, they may
let that player catch the disc in a tough position on the field (sideline,
close to endzone, etc). Then, they will hope that their mark could force a
turnover and that the other defenders downfield would recognize that the
player with the disc can only throw to the open side. Therefore, those players
would clamp down defensively and the offense as a whole would come to a
complete halt. I would rather have no one that puts the team offensively in
that position than have a few people who just dominate marks.</p>

        <p><a href="/author/chris-talarico/">Chris Talarico</a></p>
    
    <p>Sometimes the easiest way to break the mark is just to let someone else do it.
I mean, break throws are hard. Do I really want to go to the trouble of
pivoting all over the place, faking out the mark, getting off a potentially
risky throw&hellip; and then perhaps get hacked by the mark for my efforts? Forget
it. I just don&rsquo;t need that kind of hassle.</p>
<p>Not everyone can break the mark at will, and even for those who have great
break throws, it can still be a somewhat risky pass at times. Hopefully, some
of the other authors have provided some good tips on actually getting off
break throws&hellip; here&rsquo;s an easy way to get the disc to the break side that
doesn&rsquo;t require a skilled thrower:</p>
<p>This simple play can be applied anywhere on the field, but is particularly
useful to punch it in when you&rsquo;re near the goalline.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Set a stack with 5 cutters, leaving just the person with the disc and one dump in the backfield.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Position the dump relatively close to the thrower on the open side (within 6-8 yards), and a couple yards behind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The dump should start his cut going upfield. His defender needs to respect this upfield cut, and as soon as he commits to it (that is, when he turns his hips to run upfield), the dump needs to plant, and head back toward the thrower.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This cut should take him not directly at the thrower, but a just a couple yards behind him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now all the thrower needs to do is put up a little dump pass, either straight back or slightly to the break side as the dump cuts across the field from the open side toward the break side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The dump should receive the pass more or less directly behind the thrower, and allow his momentum to take him just past the thrower and his mark on the break side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And since the dump&rsquo;s defender is trailing behind him, he should have an unmarked throw to space anywhere on the break side. He likely won&rsquo;t have enough separation to stop, set himself and throw, but it should still be an easy backhand on the run because it just needs to go out to space to let a cutter run onto it.</p>
</li>
</ul>

    <h4><a href="https://the-huddle.indiaultimate.org/issue-014/every-fake-make-be-a-viable-throw/" itemprop="headline">Every Fake Make Be A Viable Throw</a></h4>
    
        <p><a href="/author/chelsea-putnam/">Chelsea Putnam</a></p>
    
    <p>The best piece of advice I ever received about breaking the mark is that every
fake must be a viable throw. You need to create space in order to break the
mark; strong fakes are going to make that happen. Many defenders choose to
watch only the disc when they are marking (don&rsquo;t do that, defenders!) and
therefore they are reacting to your fakes. By making realistic fakes, with the
disc and your upper body movement, you will get your defender to shift their
weight and be off-balance for a moment. That will create the space you need to
break your mark.</p>
<p>This means not having two hands on the disc, which for newer players can be
uncomfortable. You cannot throw the disc with two hands, so you should not be
faking with two hands.</p>
<p>It also means faking at different levels. If you like to throw low, then you
need to throw some high fakes to move the defenders hands up.</p>
<p>In addition, it means learning to throw multiple fakes on one side, either the
forehand or backhand. It takes too much time when you simply pivot back and
forth, and there is nothing wrong with throwing more than one fake on a side.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that your movements with the disc in your hand should have
a purpose and be realistic. This will force your defender to be off-balance
and will create the space you need to break the mark.</p>

        <p><a href="/author/tully-beatty/">Tully Beatty</a></p>
    
    <p>2000 Open Finals: Condors vs Furious George. It&rsquo;s four even. Mike Grant [of
FG] is defended by Corey Sanford. Mike runs a sort of S-cut in the end zone.
Jeff Cruicshank with the disc. He seems to look break mark for a righty
backhand, then he pivots big for his lefty inside out backhand, throws a
quick, strong fake, and then he throws the inside out backhand to Grant. The
throw is right in the sweet spot, safely away from Corey&rsquo;s extended hand. The
two pump fakes are a lesson in economy, followed by the big pivot.</p>
<p>I pivot. That&rsquo;s my favorite move. Pivot to the point where most players would
pull a hamstring or fall over. In some of these clinics I&rsquo;ve been running for
area college teams, I&rsquo;m puzzled by the lack of extended pivoting. How far can
you step out there or how fast can you step through the mark? If I&rsquo;m forced
backhand (I&rsquo;m a southpaw remember), I step as far as I can; rarely do I throw
the step-back forehand. If the force is forehand, it&rsquo;s very much the same. I
pivot and deliver the inside-out usually at a 45 degree angle. If the throw is
meant to be shorter, the effort is to step through the mark and deliver the
backhand. This action leads to the second question here. The most important
thing in teaching young players to break the mark is this: Your ambition to
break the mark is what usually causes the foul.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re more than likely better off having two or three who are fundamentally
sound, can hit a variety of throws, under different degrees of pressure, while
the rest do what they&rsquo;re supposed to do and play their role.</p>

    <p>One of my favorite fakes is really quite quick (maybe a quarter of a second of
motion), and from the waist up looks exactly like I am going to move my pivot
foot for an around break, but I immediately step out for an inside break. My
head and torso kind of lunge to one side, and I move the disc quite quickly in
the same direction, but my lower body remains stationary. Essentially, I move
just enough for the defender to commit to the big around, giving me a quick
and easy inside break.</p>
<p>What is most important in teaching young players to break the mark?</p>
<p>Practice. Good mechanics and confidence should be the result of endless
practice. Various studies and sources I&rsquo;ve run across throw around some pretty
large numbers when in comes to how many times you need to repeat a task before
becoming truly proficient, and ten thousand is on the low side. If a young
player thinks they&rsquo;ve thrown enough, they haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><strong><em>Which do you feel is more important: Having a lot of players that can break
the mark, or having some players on the field that can break the mark very
well?</em></strong></p>
<p>Both situations have their advantages, but if I had my choice I would prefer
everybody on my team be able to break the mark, as opposed to have a couple
people break the mark well. Apart from the complications the latter situation
might produce in trying to create an offensive scheme, any time you have a
predictable situation presented to the defense, if it can be stopped, it will
eventually be stopped. If every time player X gets the disc they look to break
the mark (because nobody else on the field can), the defense will eventually
key in and plug that hole.</p>

        <p><a href="/author/kath-ratcliff/">Kath Ratcliff</a></p>
    
    <p>By far the most effective &ldquo;move&rdquo; for breaking the mark that I&rsquo;ve found is one
that is rarely (but with increasing frequency) used in the women&rsquo;s game. The
general idea is that you throw a backhand over the mark&rsquo;s shoulder (while
being forced backhand) to the I/O lane, while using the step forward to throw
as your first step running for the give-go.</p>
<p>Specifically, I try to throw in the space above the mark&rsquo;s shoulder (not too
near their face), and I throw <em>down</em>. This is important, as with most high-
release throws, if you throw in the same manner as a normal or low-release
throw, the disc will tend to sail over the receiver&rsquo;s head. However, if you
throw with some i/o on it, and in a downward direction, it will float enough
to give the receiver enough time to run onto it. Additionally, if you transfer
your weight from your pivot foot to your front foot (from left to right for
rightys), then you&rsquo;re already a step ahead of your defender, on the way to
getting the disc back. I see this type of move far more frequently in the
men&rsquo;s game, where the quick give-go or dish to the handler seems more common
(but it&rsquo;s well on its way in the women&rsquo;s side). One peril of this is that you
get called for a <em>lot</em> of travels, mainly because when you transfer your
weight to the front foot, even if your back foot is still down, it really
appears that you&rsquo;re running forward. The only solution I&rsquo;ve come up with is to
play with observers and request for them to make a call on travel/no travel.</p>
<p>I think the most important thing in learning to break the mark is to think
<em>before</em> you step up to the mark how you&rsquo;re going to break it. That is, know
what you want to throw, and figure out how you&rsquo;re going to make them think
you&rsquo;re throwing something else. The other, really most important thing, is to
be able to switch your grip from forehand to backhand with only one hand on
the frisbee (don&rsquo;t grab it with your off hand) extremely quickly and
naturally. If you can&rsquo;t move the disc to the right grip faster than your mark
can move their feet, you&rsquo;ll never get a throw off. (Also, markers often watch
what grip you have and cheat to that side&hellip; at least, I do.)</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very important to have some players who can dish out the disc to
anywhere on the field regardless of mark. But, that being said, it&rsquo;s very very
important for every player to be able to <em>at least</em> break a force for a dump
throw. The throw I think is the most important here is if you&rsquo;re trapped on
the sideline and you need to throw a dump, it&rsquo;s really key that everyone on
the field is able to throw around the mark to the dump in the middle of the
field. Bonus points if everyone can throw it to space, leading the dump out to
an area where they have an easy continue throw to the break side before the
mark can catch up.</p>

    <p>What I like to do is to not let the mark dictate the throw, but for the
thrower to dictate the markers positioning and movements. In doing so, I find
teaching young players to break the mark that you must first teach them to
make themselves a threat while holding the disc. I consider the way I hold the
disc similar to what is called a triple threat in basketball. To me, this
means holding the disc in a throwing position. The throwing position that I
teach young players is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Feet placement is shoulder length apart, maybe slightly wider.</li>
<li>Knees are bent.</li>
<li>Balance is centered.</li>
<li>Hold the disc with a flick grip, ready to throw.</li>
<li>Face the mark.</li>
</ol>
<p>Steps 1-3 allow the thrower to have a strong base position. This type of
positioning allows the thrower to easily step out for the forehand and to
pivot to the backhand. Many young throwers tend to be intimidated due to an
aggressive marker straddling their pivot foot; this type of throwing position
helps to reduce the amount of straddling</p>
<p>Holding the disc in the flick grip, regardless of the force, provides the
thrower with the greatest advantage for two reasons. First, holding in the
flick position allows you to throw the flick, the hammer, scoober, and (if you
are a good enough thrower to rotate the disc into a different grip) a thumber.
Secondly, you are forcing the mark to respect the flick regardless of the
mark&rsquo;s force. Also, the rotation from flick to backhand is much smoother and
easier than the rotation from a backhand to a flick.</p>
<p>As stated in step 5, I teach the thrower to face the mark. The benefits of
facing the mark are that the mark is no longer able to position closely to
your pivot foot, thereby allowing you to pivot more freely; and you force the
mark to respect the flick regardless of the force. The flick is a very quick
throw, so to break the mark you will only need to step out slightly and throw
to space.</p>
<p>What this positioning has done is you have forced the marker to make a
decision. The marker can play you straight up, and you are able to get a quick
and easy break mark throw off. Alternatively, they can overcompensate to the
flick side which will then allow you pivot to break the mark with an easy
backhand. Many times, with an aggressive mark, you will note that they
overplay the flick position to start, and with a simple pivot they bust to
stop the backhand (which they will do aggressively as well) opening up the
easy flick break.</p>
<p>Another reason to face the mark, the closer you are to the sideline force, the
more important it is to move the disc off the sideline, which will usually
require some type of break throw.</p>
<p>Lastly, I try to teach throwers to recognize the angles and space to which
they are throwing. I try to have them envision themselves in a triangle with
the receiver. The third point being the space to which they are throwing. This
works best with live people, as the throwers are able to see how the angle or
place to where they are throwing the disc impacts the difficulty of the throw,
and in turn the completion percentage.</p>
<p>A 3 or 4 person drill used to help develop the easy break throws was to set up
a 10 yds x 10 yds box. A thrower and maker would be at the bottom halfway
between the bottom left and right corners, with the receiver and defender at
the upper right corner. The marker would then mark at the appropriate 45
degree angle (flick) protecting the upper left corner. The thrower then
initiates the throw to the upper left corner (either flick or around backhand)
and the receiver trys to catch the disc within the box. Keep repeating. This
helps the thrower learn how to move the mark and where the space is for break
mark throws.</p>

        <p><a href="/author/adam-goff/">Adam Goff</a></p>
    
    <p>Every time a team moves the disc, this changes the defense. It puts the
defensive players out of position, if even for a short period of time. The
greater change is better for the offense, and this means putting the disc as
far from where the defense wants it to be as possible. If a team is forcing
you to throw forehand, and you get a chance to complete a pass straight up
field, you just made a good move. If you get a chance to go a little moreâ€”30Â°
sayâ€”then that&rsquo;s a little better. But breaking the mark is just a successful
throw that happened to go that way.</p>
<p>I almost never think about breaking the mark. (I almost never think about the
marker at all, really.) I know where I want the disc to be, and I know where
the defense doesn&rsquo;t want the disc to be. If I get a chance to put the disc
there, then I need to be ready to take advantage of that chance. To me, this
is no different than being able to take advantage of any open cutâ€”open side,
break side, anywhere. I want all of those throws to be as easy as possible,
and to do that, I need the mark to move enough to make it easy.</p>
<p>I think that every move that a thrower makes has to be a legitimate move to
make a throw. Every move you make as a thrower, you are communicating to the
mark, to your cutters, to the defenders upfield. Every move must communicate
something. A &ldquo;fake&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t do that. Idris Nolan wrote somewhere on the
Internet that he never fakes. I believe that a fake is just a throw you didn&rsquo;t
let go of: it has to look the same. Now the marker doesn&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re
doing, and moving your mark is simple. If I make a move to throw a backhand
swing against a forehand mark (if everything I&rsquo;ve done so far is something I
could&rsquo;ve thrown) then the marker moves just enough that I can throw little IO.</p>
<p>When teaching newer players (or those up-fielders who just don&rsquo;t get it) about
throwing some of the more difficult throws, I almost never teach about
&ldquo;breaking the mark.&rdquo; I talk about the importance of it, but I teach about
moving the mark with controlled, committed motion. Every move could be a
throw. Every move is done with balance.</p>
<p>Another thing that I work on with players which aids in breaking the mark is
working on the shape of every throw. It&rsquo;s important to put the disc in the
right shape (flat to a straight cut, a little roll into the receiver, always
leading the cut). Working on all of these shapes helps players break the mark,
even if that&rsquo;s not the topic at hand.</p>
<p>One more thought: remember that the goal is not to &ldquo;break the mark.&rdquo; The goal
is to make it easy to score. It&rsquo;s ok to take two throws to get it there. If
there is a gimme throw up the gut to someone who can then easily push the disc
over the break side. It&rsquo;s just happened about as fast if you did it. It might
be safer, and you&rsquo;re still putting the defense out of position almost as
quickly.</p>

    <p>My favorite move, that is very popular and can be used by any player, is the
shimmy flick. This is a move that I was taught at Carleton but is based on
principles that I learned in my first sport, basketball. In basketball as a
defender, you are always taught to look at the offense&rsquo;s belly-button because
that is the hardest part of the body to fake with. You can get faked out if
you look at the ball, the player&rsquo;s head, feet or hands, but the belly button&rsquo;s
not going anywhere unless the whole player is too. In ultimate, as a thrower,
to get the defense to move you have to move your belly button or, more
realistically, your hips. To do the shimmy flick, you start squared up to the
downfield and you want to move the mark to a right-handed player&rsquo;s left side
(to the backhand side) to open up the inside-out forehand lane. So you shimmy
your hips to the left without changing your grip. As you shimmy, you&rsquo;re
actually winding up for a forehand so as the defender moves to the backhand
side, you are preparing to throw a forehand. For more success step out to the
forehand side and get low.</p>
<p>As a reference to my coaches, Michael [Baccarini of Paideia] and Tiina [Booth
of Amherst], you can always break the mark by getting low. High releases may
be fancy and fun, but in bad weather they will be bad throws. The most
important thing to breaking the mark is getting low quickly and throwing with
lots of zip.</p>
<p>As a team strategy, I think it is important to have some players on the field
who can break the mark well and have all players on the field understand the
limitations and preferences of every other player so they can cut to the
proper place on the field.</p>

    <p>Breaking the mark is key to scoring against solid defense and an important
factor to any offense. Here are 5 ways to dictate play and gain an advantage
over your mark:</p>
<p><strong>1. Expanding your options early (become more threatening)</strong></p>
<p>Since at the beginning of the game the defense is trying to figure out your
strengths and weaknesses to properly apply pressure, this is your opportunity
to take advantage and become more threatening. A good defender will start with
a standard mark by trying to stop two primary breaks, the &lsquo;inside-out&rsquo; and the
&lsquo;around&rsquo;. As play goes on, your mark learns from the options you take and
changes their mark accordingly to make it harder on you. Having the disc, and
knowing this, you have a chance to take advantage and become a bigger threat.
If you use a throw, potentially less conventional (high release flick,
scoober, push pass, etc.), you aren&rsquo;t as confident in early when there isn&rsquo;t
much pressure being applied to that throw, you condition the defender to
consider this a threat to their mark. With this, the defender will consider
this option a potential break and adapt their mark to incorporate this. This
will shift pressure off of your more confident throws, allowing you to use
them effectively later in the game.</p>
<p><strong>2. Minimize Pivots</strong></p>
<p>Every time you pivot, you are changing the downfield offense&rsquo;s point of attack
(break side or open side), reestablishing your balance, and wasting a stall
count. An average pivot takes 1 stall count to perform, so if you pivot 3
times in one possession, you only have 1-2 stall counts to look up field
before you will need to dump. This gives little time to set up and execute a
break efficiently. By pivoting less, not just do you maintain better balance
over the possession, but you make the pivot more valuable as the defender will
not know when you&rsquo;re going to pivot. This can catch the defender off balance,
get them to over commit to an open side look or lure them into a false sense
of security, increasing your chances of executing a successful break.</p>
<p><strong>3. Fake only what you can throw</strong></p>
<p>Good defenders are dynamic and are using every possession to get a better
understanding of what you want to throw. Your mark is using every piece of
information to hone in on what you prefer, and how to use this to generate
turnovers. Faking a throw you don&rsquo;t have not only wastes a stall count but
also lets the defender know their pressure is working, gives the defender
knowledge on what options you use and which you don&rsquo;t, and encourages them to
clamp down even more. Also, unnecessary fakes can become patterns to your
throwing routine which good defenders can also catch onto. Maintaining
composure and confidence during possession, instead of faking unnecessarily,
will keep you focused on executing your throw and keep the defender from
pinning down an optimal strategy for applying pressure to your throws.</p>
<p><strong>4. Don&rsquo;t force it</strong></p>
<p>All of us have done the 3-man mark drill. One person throws, one person
receives and the last person puts on a hard straight up mark trying to prevent
the pass (usually starting on some high stall count). In this drill, a
defender will usually feel successful if they can manage a certain percentage
of blocks/turnovers. In turn, the defender will clamp down on the strategy
they have used that has been successful and apply more pressure and intensity,
making it hard to dictate to the mark as you would want. In a game, this is
much the same. By attempting to break unsuccessfully, your defender gains
confidence in their marking strategy, and increases intensity and pressure. If
you can manage to attempt less breaks but succeed a much higher percentage of
the time (only take the option when you are 99% confident), it forces the mark
to respect this option more by making them understand that any look to the
break side, if thrown, is going to be a success. This will keep the defender
reactive to you rather than vice versa.</p>
<p><strong>5. Make open side throws devastating</strong></p>
<p>This one seems to be the most overlooked, and also most important. A good
defensive unit is going to prevent offensive flow and make your offense score
using their least favored options. For example, a good hucking offensive team
will be forced to work the disc under against a good, smart defense. This idea
is seen in tennis most often. A good tennis player will play to his opponent&rsquo;s
weakest shot the whole match. An opponent with an incredibly strong forehand
but average backhand will be forced to hit 85% of this shots as backhands in
order to win. Any big tennis fans will refer to Wimbledon &lsquo;08 where Nadal
defeated Federer. If you look back at this match, you will notice that Nadal
played at least 80% of his shots to Federer&rsquo;s backhand. This was not only
because Nadal&rsquo;s forehand is his weapon but because Federer&rsquo;s least threatening
shot is his backhand.</p>
<p>In this regard, the best way to make the break easier is to make your open
side throws seem even more threatening than your break throws. If you can
continue to deal out devastating throws on the open side, a mark will
eventually start to inch over to hinder this option in an attempt to create a
turnover opportunity. When this happens, the defender has exposed the weak
side and you should have an easy break option.</p>

    <h4><a href="https://the-huddle.indiaultimate.org/issue-014/you-never-have-to-break-the-mark-if-/" itemprop="headline">You Never Have To Break The Mark If...</a></h4>
    
        <p><a href="/author/vy-chow/">VY Chow</a></p>
    
    <p>There are some basic concepts that everyone talks about to effectively break
the mark:</p>
<ol>
<li>use your core to stay balanced while you fake and pivot to get your marker off balance;</li>
<li>learn to fake and throw/release at different heights;</li>
<li>engage your marker by drawing them closer or moving them side-to-side with your pivots.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, my favourite &lsquo;move&rsquo; to teach, regardless of playing level, is how to
redefine your throwing lanes when you have the disc. Put more simply, don&rsquo;t
let the marker control your throwing lanes.</p>
<p>Almost all players catch the frisbee and then, if they don&rsquo;t throw a continue
pass right away, square up with the line of scrimmage irrespective of where
the marker sets up. Likely the only adjustment that is made occurs at the
sideline when players are often told to keep their behind to the sideline. But
that adjustment is a general concept that can be used anywhere on the field.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the disc on the sideline example. When a thrower close to the
sideline stands with her bum to the sideline instead of square with the line
of scrimmage, she automatically shifts the throwing lanes to facilitate an
easier dump pass to get the disc off the sideline. If marker shifts position
in response, the thrower now has the upper hand and is dictating what/where
the throwing lanes are and where she can throw. Doing the same thing away from
the sideline often produces remarkable results. If the mark is forcing one-
way, the thrower should square up to the marker instead of the line of
scrimmage. In doing this, the thrower has now shifted the field and created
different throwing lanes - the thrower is now playing the mark more straight-
up. The inside-out throw looks more like a regular open-side throw and that
step-around doesn&rsquo;t really look like a step-around break anymore but looks
more like another open-side throw. With a flat mark, the thrower should try
turning his hips one direction or the other, so that they aren&rsquo;t square with
the marker and see what happens.</p>
<p>Whatever the mark, don&rsquo;t simply square up to the line of scrimmage. Set
yourself up so that you take control of your throwing lanes. And you might
find that you never really seem to throw a &lsquo;break mark&rsquo; throw&hellip;</p>
