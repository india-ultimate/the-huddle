          The Layout Block
        </h1>
        <p>Issue 19 &mdash; Wednesday, May 27, 2009</p>
        
    </div>
    <div class="content col col-12">
        <p><em>(This past week for the first birthday of The Huddle, Kirk Savage got
us a present...Al Nichols' article about layout blocks. Kind of like
reading about 'Playing well in the 4th quarter&quot; by Larry Bird. Thanks
to everyone that has supported us all year!)</em></p>
<p>You've trained, you've watched film, and you know your opponent. Maybe
you've been waiting all game, all season, or your entire Ultimate life
to take a layout block from that player in a big game. Like hitting a
walk-off home-run. Like marching around your hometown with the Stanley
Cup in your Radio Flyer.Â </p>
<p>Many mediocre players spent many hours visualizing these outcomes. The
best defenders, though, try to understand the process that can get you
to that block. How should you plan to create block opportunities? Where
should your feet be? Your core? Your arms?</p>
<p>Your mind?</p>
<p>We asked our authors how they play this situation, and how they think
about it themselves both as a player and a coach. Enjoy.&hellip;and then go
get some of your own!</p>

    <p>I don&rsquo;t remember ever thinking &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for a layout block&rdquo; or &ldquo;I need to be
in a position to get a layout block on this throw.&rdquo; My goal was simply to be
in the best position I could be in to cover the person who was my
responsibility at the time. I believe that layout blocks are simply
&lsquo;opportunities taken&rsquo;â€”being in the right place at the right time, and the
offense made just enough of a mistake for you to go get it. However, there are
a few situations where simple choices can put you in a slightly better
position for that elusive layout block. I&rsquo;ll describe one of the common ones
here.</p>
<p>Defensive positioning is often about angles. As the defender, you want to own
the better angle to the disc after it is thrown. So, here&rsquo;s the situation: You
are covering an upfield cutter who makes a cut on an angle towards the open
side of the field, as shown in figure 1. This cut does happen in both vertical
and horizontal stacks, although the angle may be less when the cut is in the
horizontal stack.</p>
<p><img src="/images/Issue019_Goff_illustration1.png" alt="Issue019 Goff illustration1"><br>
As the cutter makes the cut, you the defender may become increasingly out of
position. You&rsquo;ll be on the outside of the receiver and then the receiver owns
the angle.<br>
<img src="/images/Issue019_Goff_illustration2.png" alt="Issue019 Goff illustration2"><br>
Many of the layout blocks that I&rsquo;ve gotten, have been in this situation.
Instead of staying on the outside or trying to stay in front of the receiver,
I slide back a step and take the inside. I do this after the angle of the
throw gets to be to the receivers advantage if I stay on the &lsquo;force side.&rsquo;<br>
<img src="/images/Issue019_Goff_illustration3.png" alt="Issue019 Goff illustration3"><br>
When the throw goes up, you the defender are now in position to make that
layout blockâ€”you own the angle. The same theory applies to other situations on
the field.</p>

  <div class="post" id="baiting">
    <h4><a href="https://the-huddle.indiaultimate.org/issue-019/baiting/" itemprop="headline">Baiting</a></h4>
    
        <p><a href="/author/brett-matzuka/">Brett Matzuka</a></p>
    
    <p>This is a skill that many of the top defenders possess which generates lots of
lay out blocks. There are 3 key components to a successful baited block.</p>
<p><strong>1. Knowing the offense (thrower/cutter)</strong></p>
<p>To many, this is just knowing how far away you can let your player get before
you can&rsquo;t make up the ground in time to get a bid on the pass. Knowing how
much ground you can make up on your player when the disc goes up is the most
important part to knowing the offense; if you can&rsquo;t regain the ground when the
disc is thrown, you surely won&rsquo;t get the block. However, also knowing the
current offensive circumstance and the thrower will be the icing on the cake.
A good thrower is patient and confident with the disc and will look off an
even slightly questionable pass for another option, or if they choose to throw
it, are more likley to place it far enough away to prevent the opportunity for
a bid. An average thrower, however, will be more likely try to unload the disc
quickly, which should give you the opportunity for the baited block. Other key
factors to consider are: Did the thrower just receive the disc with a zero
count, or is the count high? are they trapped on the line or at center field?
Is the there offensive flow currently or not? All these questions will have a
big affect on whether the bait and bid is successful, or whether you may
overcommit and expose your defense to a devastating blow.</p>
<p><strong>2. Be on your toes (literally)</strong></p>
<p>If you are baiting for a block, be ready to actually get the block. Too many
times a defender has given up a few steps unintentionally, sees the impending
throw to their man, and actually manages to make up the ground but doesn&rsquo;t get
in position to convert the block. To turn this from a run past and expose your
defense to an unmarked man to a lay out D, you have to prepare a few steps
before you are within striking distance. Simply put, when you are 3 to 4 steps
away from making a play, get low and maximize the amount of spring you can get
from your legs, (much like a lay up in basketball) take your 2-3 short step
routine to prepare to explode, and then execute. If you don&rsquo;t prepare to bid a
few steps before, it will pass you by.</p>
<p><strong>3. Desire</strong></p>
<p>This sounds cheesy and much like a cliche, but it is honestly the truth. You
can have both of the above and still not manage to get the block. This last
part completes the package. You give the offensive player enough steps to look
like a viable option while still maintaining enough distance to make a bid.
The throw goes up and you make up the ground while preparing for the bid by
getting low and going through the lay out routine. However, if you lack the
passion, determination, or desire, you will hear a lot of people
congratulating you on a nice bid, and just that, bid, not D. Desire here isn&rsquo;t
just defined as your thirst for the disc, but as the focus and attention to
any inconsequential detail or deviation that might potentially prevent the bid
from becoming a block. That millisecond that you explode horizontally into the
air, you have to be so focused and hungry for the disc that you keep your eye
locked onto the disc (where it is going, where the offensive player plans to
catch it, etc.) and position your body, limbs, and hands in a way to
deflect/catch the disc while accounting for any deviation from your initial
preparation that has occured along the flight path. This, simply put, is
desire. Not letting any hiccup prevent you from making your lay out eventuate
into a D.</p>
<p>If you can manage to learn these 3 components, hurling yourself through the
air will be the easy part that puts the icing on the cake.</p>

    <p>D, they say, is for dummies. But no D player worth their salt should have the
ability to do anything more than stare at their big toe Saturday night at the
hotel. Why? Because they should be too mentally taxed from keeping the stall
count each time they step on the field for D. I&rsquo;m not talking about counting
the stall when marking your assignment; I&rsquo;m talking about keeping the stall
when playing D in the stack or spread. Any O player doing the same thing at
stall 4 and stall 8 is giving their defender at chance at the grail. Of course
you can&rsquo;t do it every possession of every point of every game early in the
series and you shouldn&rsquo;t need to do it you&rsquo;re a 1 seed facing a 16 seed, but
by the 3rd round at sectionals, it&rsquo;s time to say goodbye to Mickey Mouse
Frisbee and work yourself into a mental lather; and if you&rsquo;re on a team that
demands up-calls and a vocal sideline, then even better for you. Obviously
it&rsquo;s more difficult when defending the spread, but if you bide your time and
sit on a team&rsquo;s offense long enough and other defenders are digging in, you
figure the O out and sometimes you get the grail, other times you see yourself
in its reflection.</p>
<p>Hard to believe it&rsquo;s almost been ten years, but my wife&rsquo;s block vs RFBF in the
&lsquo;99 Mixed finals is the best layout block I&rsquo;ve ever seen. The block earned her
a concussion and the Llama a trip to Germany [and recently I read where
someone said Mixed is for pansies]. A deep shot was sent to the girl she was
guarding but Matt Hull leaped a got a finger on the disc, deflecting its
course and Amy was able to come back under, layout and knock it down,
simultaneously taking a knee to the back of the head and getting knocked the
hell out.</p>
<p>On a lighter note, at Fools one year, I saw KD, after shot-gunning not one but
two beers during a time-out, get a layout block on a dump pass that was thrown
by the guy he was marking. The pass couldn&rsquo;t have gone two yards before he
blocked it. It was pretty sweet.</p>

  <div class="post" id="footwork">
    <h4><a href="https://the-huddle.indiaultimate.org/issue-019/footwork/" itemprop="headline">Footwork</a></h4>
    
        <p><a href="/author/miranda-roth/">Miranda Roth</a></p>
    
    <p>The skill I&rsquo;ve used most and tried to teach my players more than any other
part of getting a layout block (aside from the obvious WANTING IT BAD part) is
the footwork required to get a layout block. The obvious problem about getting
a layout D is that you are trying to get to something that is being blocked by
your offense&rsquo;s body. I think getting a layout D without getting called for a
foul/hurting anyone is huge.</p>
<p>So how do you do it? Think about your footworkâ€”it&rsquo;s all about angles. In
soccer, the goalkeeper thinks about closing down the anglesâ€”as the person with
the ball gets closer to her in a breakaway, she does not want to take steps
backwards because that just opens up more of the goal to the shooter. Instead
she takes steps toward the dribbler to close down the angles. I think about
angles similar to these when preparing to get a layout D.</p>
<p>Imagine a situation in which you are a defender trailing your offense by a
step on an in-cut on a diagonal toward the sideline. This is a very common
occurrence, especially if the offense is playing a vertical stack offense. If
you are able to make up two steps on that offense, you can get a layout D.
Here&rsquo;s how:</p>
<ol>
<li>Second to last step on a diagonal to the inside of your offense (parallel to the sideline)</li>
<li>Last step forward into your layout lane (parallel to the offense&rsquo;s running path)</li>
<li>Get the layout D</li>
</ol>
<p>The beauty of this is that the thrower doesn&rsquo;t see you as a threat so they
will throw this throw. You also can continue in your same speed instead of
slowing down to get around someone and they often don&rsquo;t feel you since you are
taking an inside lane a step away from where they are running. This works
particularly well for people who get layout Ds with speed (doing this footwork
fast) or tall people, like me, who can gain a good deal of ground with the
layout (getting into the lane so as not to dive into the receiver).</p>

    <h4><a href="https://the-huddle.indiaultimate.org/issue-019/how-to-get-a-layout-block/" itemprop="headline">How To Get A Layout Block</a></h4>
    
        <p><a href="/author/al-nichols/">Al Nichols</a></p>
    
    <p>In the perfect defensive scenario, no one ever has to get a layout block. The
marker does a great job of taking away part of the field and preventing hucks.
Lane cutter defenders deny any open space to downfield receivers and when the
count is getting higher, the dump defender stuffs the reset option. The
thrower is left with nothing and quietly puts down the disc after hearing the
word ten. How often does that happen?</p>
<p>I think most teams and their defensive players are not attempting to get a
block on any given point but rather trying to prevent their opponents from
getting open enough for a high percentage pass. Relatively easy to do against
opponents who struggle to throw it long or to break the mark but increasingly
difficult with better throwers and receivers. Against stronger throwers and
receivers the defender is forced to position themselves closer to their
opponent and as a result you often find yourself chasing someone as opposed to
dictating to them where they can go. Most layout blocks come about from this
position, where receiver is in full flight to an open space, a step or two
ahead of their defender, and the only defensive play left after the disc is up
is a layout bid. I&rsquo;ve always found that there are three parts to making the
play: put yourself in position, seize the opportunity and a small mistake from
the offensive players.</p>
<p><strong>Positon</strong><br>
The reality for most defenders is that you have to make a wide variety of
positional choices throughout a point, slightly altering these choices
depending on the team defensive strategy of the point, where the disc is on
the field, what the count is, your direct opponents strengths and weaknesses,
weather conditions and if you have time to check it out, the throwing
abilities of the person with the disc. But most of the time, in a man
defensive scenario, I&rsquo;ve always lined up about a step on the open side of the
field and a step closer to the disc. If your receiver goes long or to the
break side of the field they&rsquo;re already a little open without even having to
get you moving and you find yourself already chasing behind the receiver.
Though these passes are slightly higher risk, against good throwers the
defender has to bite on these cuts and try to stay as close as possible, so
when a receiver cuts back to the open side you will still often find yourself
chasing a receiver into the open side coming back to the disc even though your
initial position was to deny that particular cut. Defenders often find
themselves chasing receivers, offense dictating to the d, where the action is
going to take place. Fortunately, if you going to get a block against a good
thrower they usually have to see the receiver break open or the throw doesn&rsquo;t
go up. But to get the block you need to have that opening be as small as
possible. Too close and the throw doesn&rsquo;t go up, but hey great d. Too far
behind and you&rsquo;ll never make a play, just get ready to start marking. But
about one step off the pace and you&rsquo;re in position to maybe make a play.</p>
<p><strong>Opportunity</strong><br>
Whenever I&rsquo;ve been in the zone defensively and we&rsquo;re playing a lot of man d, I
am able to put myself in the defensive position of about a step behind my
receiver consistently all game. And the moment we break into open space I&rsquo;m
already hoping for a throw with every intention of laying out and making the
d. It is already in my mind. The timing of a layout block is critical and if
you&rsquo;re not ready to dive it&rsquo;s probably too late. Almost all high-level-
experienced players will lay out to catch the disc on O. The disc is right in
front of you, the expectation of everyone on the field and sidelines is that
you will at least try a layout if it is necessary. On D there&rsquo;s no guarantee
that the throw will even go up, that if it does you will necessarily have a
shot at the disc but you have to assume that there&rsquo;s going to be an
opportunity. You&rsquo;re never going to get it by going around the person behind
them, so you have to figure out when and where you&rsquo;re going to go inside his
trailing shoulder, without making contact. These are the two major steps in
seizing the opportunity: be ready and willing, and find an angle on the inside
the receiver between him and the disc.</p>
<p><strong>The Mistake(s)</strong><br>
If you&rsquo;re way faster than your opponent then when the throw goes up, blow by
your receiver and lay out or just catch it. For most players speed is fairly
even.</p>
<p>To get the block, no matter how well positioned and how ready to lay out you
still need a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake#1</strong><br>
If a thrower reads his receiver&rsquo;s position and speed relative to the defender
and throws it perfectly out in front of their teammate to run onto with arms
extended, the defender has no play. Get ready to mark. But if they throw it so
the disc is going to arrive right into the receiver&rsquo;s body, maybe you&rsquo;ve got a
chance. Being only one step behind and launching with arm fully extended
should make up the gap and give you a chance to catch or tip the incoming
disc. (I&rsquo;ve always favoured launching and landing on my side for both comfort
and efficacy because reaching with one arm will give you an extra few inches
that could be key. I think it&rsquo;s also more likely to avoid contact.)</p>
<p><strong>Mistake#2</strong><br>
Even if the thrower misses his angle by enough of a margin to give you a
chance for a dive block, a smart receiver can change his angle to protect the
disc. Instead of continuing to run at the angle he initiated, when the
receiver sees the disc is going to be a little behind him or at his body, they
should make a more direct line back to the thrower to protect the disc. This
cuts off the defender&rsquo;s angle and forces them to not lay out or if they do
it&rsquo;s almost impossible to avoid contact. Fortunately, a lot of receivers think
they are more open then they are and will continue on their initial line. Run
softly.</p>

        <p><a href="/author/jeff-eastham-anderson/">Jeff Eastham-Anderson</a></p>
    
    <p>Two key factors of getting a block are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being able to recognize mistakes by the offense</li>
<li>Being in a good position to capitalize upon them</li>
</ul>
<p>Being faster than the person you&rsquo;re guarding helps, but paying attention to
these two aspects will help your team defensively.</p>
<p>When it comes to positioning, as a defender I rarely bait throws in
anticipation of a layout block, especially when it comes to cuts that are
close to the disc. There is so little time to react, that my defensive goal is
to deny the throw. It just happens that the position to deny those kinds of
throws (even with or trailing the offensive player slightly, on the side
closest to the thrower), also allows for the occasional layout attempt. If you
are directly behind, or on the wrong side of the receiver, layout bids become
more difficult, and can be very dangerous to everyone involved.</p>
<p>Recognizing when the offense makes a mistake is the other key factor that
determines whether or not you should make a layout attempt. For the majority
of layout blocks I get, I knew when and where the disc was going to be thrown
at the same time as, or earlier than, the receiver. Being able to look
directly at the thrower, and keep the receiver in my peripheral vision gives
me equal footing when it comes to making a play on the disc. Alternatively, if
the receiver is making a one dimensional cut (i.e. the disc will be thrown to
them at point X, or not all), this also lets me get into a good defensive
position, and ready to make a bid.</p>
<p>Once the disc is in the air and I&rsquo;ve decided I&rsquo;m going attempt a block, if my
positioning is good I can choose the best line to take to get to the disc
without having to worry about what the receiver is doing. Whatever line the
receiver chooses, the defender has a bit of an advantage here as they do not
have to actually catch the disc. The slightest tip with a finger, or the mere
presence of your body, is sometimes good enough. The only real insight I have
on execution is that I try to drive off of the last step I take, just as I
would if I was jumping in the air. Just because you&rsquo;re running as fast as you
can doesn&rsquo;t mean you should stop running and fall forward in the hope of
getting a block.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really sure how you learn the body motions to successfully make a
block. Certainly there is timing involved, and landing in a controlled manner
is a plus. A high-jump mat, or sand pit would reduce the wear and tear, but at
some point you&rsquo;re going to have to graduate to the hard stuff. As I mentioned
above, drive off the last step you take. The primary impact should be taken by
your abdomen hitting the ground as flatly as possible. After every practice
attempt, get up as quickly as possible and set an imaginary mark. Not every
bid is successful, and you will have set the mark if you miss.</p>

    <p>Ah the layout block, the play that got you started, the one you still dream
about, the slam dunk of our game. Or maybe the three-pointer.</p>
<p>On a bad throw everyone can get what looks like a good block. That&rsquo;s why you
play summer league. But when teams are executing well, coming up with a piece
is tough. Don&rsquo;t over-commit to laying out or you will end up getting burned on
jukes and lying on the ground as the person you are supposed to cover has a
free throw.</p>
<p>Which is to say that layout&rsquo;s, like all blocks, come from team defense. If
everyone is always going for a layout block (like everyone heaving up three-
pointers) each player might look good once and a while, but mostly you will
have a bunch of teammates playing as individual, not applying pressure as a
team.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t just count on your best players to get blocks for you. Your top
defenders have to cover top O players and O has the advantage. Great defenders
play well within a team conceptâ€”forcing deep, forcing out, whateverâ€”and set up
their layout blocks within that concept. They know that most offensive players
have a few pet moves. If you can identify them, you have a better chance of
getting a block. But players today are too athletic to bait. Let your team
bring pressure; you make the play when it comes your way. Unless it&rsquo;s summer
league, your block should be the play everyone celebrates because they all
helped make it happenâ€”even if you get the glory.</p>

    <p>Like all things holy, the more you try to explain it with words, the farther
you get from its essence&hellip;</p>
<p>Look: If you are on the field and thinking about getting a layout block,
you&rsquo;re likely not playing good defense. I don&rsquo;t think there is a recipe for
getting a layout block . I suppose you could practice, and I have seen people
working on their diving and landing techniques. But it also requires a
tremendous amount of luck.</p>
<p>First, the thrower has to make a decision that throwing to your man is the
best option. This point sounds obvious, but it&rsquo;s important to recognize. It
means that for whatever reason, the throw either yields a big reward compared
to the risk of turnover, or the thrower miscalculates and thinks the receiver
is more open than she is. Let&rsquo;s say you are the best defender on the team and
consistently smother whoever you are guarding. You will end up with no layout
blocks if the throwers always look off your man. How many layout blocks you
get should never be the barometer of the quality of your defense.</p>
<p>Second, the thrower has to make a bad throw. Perhaps the throw is a little too
far on the inside, or floated a little too long. Whatever happened, you had
the time to hurl yourself at it and get a piece. But if you blocked the throw,
it should have never been thrown or it should have been thrown better. Good
throwers and cutters know this. If you are thinking &ldquo;layout block&rdquo; and baiting
a throw, they will make you pay by either putting the disc out to space where
you can&rsquo;t get it or throwing a pump fake and hitting your man going the other
way.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my advice for getting layout blocks, both for individuals and for
entire teams. Play hard-nosed, take-no-prisoners defense. Follow the
guidelines for effective D that have been enumerated many other times
throughout this blog and elsewhere (dictate, triangulate, limit the cushion,
use your body, etc.). Get in your man&rsquo;s shorts and deny the disc, beating her
to every spot. And then, when the thrower does make a mistake (and even the
best will on occasion), you&rsquo;ll know what to do.</p>

        <p><a href="/author/greg-husak/">Greg Husak</a></p>
    
    <p>I&rsquo;m frequently torn between the value of a layout block versus just shutting
your guy down to the point that he&rsquo;s not thrown to. Layout blocks, at least at
the elite level, are typically the result of a bad decision or throw by the
thrower, because it is very tough to get around elite receivers, and you&rsquo;re
generally just not going to make up enough ground to go from a guy being open
to you blocking him unless the throw is in a bad spot or the receiver does a
terrible job of sealing you. That being said, I think there is definitely an
art to putting yourself in this position so that when the opportunity comes
you can take advantage.</p>
<p>The primary factor is desire. Whether it&rsquo;s the desire to keep your guy from
getting it, to get the disc or win the glory of making that play, something
has to be ticking in the defender&rsquo;s head that will make him hurl his body at
the disc. Learning the game in California we would occasionally work out and
play on the beach where the potential for injury dramatically decreases and
you start to think that maybe that&rsquo;s possible on grass too. However, despite
training and practice, at some level the layout block is an uncontrolled
action with the prime motivation to get the disc. The mind just has stay out
of the way and let the body do its thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of great blocks in big games, many of them for or against the
team I was playing on, which can bias me. However, one that I saw early in my
career, at my first nationals, is one of the few I remember that didn&rsquo;t
involve my team. It was Boston DoG, and I believe it was their epic semifinal
of 1997 against Ring of Fire. Boston pulls during their epic comeback (they
were down like 7-1 to start the game) and one of the markers in their
clam/zone is sprinting down and the first pass is about to get thrown right by
him. As he&rsquo;s sprinting he somehow launches his body at a nearly right-angle to
his left and about chest high. I actually cant even remember if he got the
block, but I know it was a super-human effort for a pass that, while it was
his responsibility, wasn&rsquo;t really to his man. As he came do the ground he
didn&rsquo;t get up and the word was that he tore his ACL, or something in his knee.
Boston went on to win that semifinal, and ultimately take down Sockeye in the
final.</p>
