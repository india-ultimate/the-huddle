      <description>In ultimate, good offense beats good defense. Defense becomes especially difficult when the opponent has a dynamic player that is both a threat with the disc and down field. Down 8-6 at the half our defensive goal is to make the opponents offense, and most importantly this dynamic player, uncomfortable. We can do this with both team and individual defensive tactics.
Suggested Team Tactics
Zone Defense: Makes the offense complete many throws to score.</description>

      <description>Here are my six recommendations to anyone who is trying out for a team of any level:
1. Be on time and have all of the appropriate equipment for the tryout.
2. Relax â€” tryouts are a high stress process for everyone involved, but as a captain/coach I&amp;rsquo;m looking to see how players handle themselves throughout the process. Tryouts are a decent representation of how players will handle high-stress situations during tournaments.</description>
