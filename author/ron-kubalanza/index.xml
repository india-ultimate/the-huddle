      <description>When I hear the &amp;ldquo;up&amp;rdquo; call I try to spot the disc, briefly and without giving up any more ground.
I need to ascertain if it has truly gone up, and if it is intended for the player I am now chasing. If both of these things are true, then I try to make some quick calculations based on what type of throw has been made.
If it is low or short, I can simply go to it and have position underneath.</description>

      <description>I am not sure what equivalent talent is but you simply have more options in a HORIZONTAL stack and the cutters are generally all closer to the ball. This is important because all four cutters are options, in and out, almost simultaneously. Additionally, using the field as 4 cutting lanes as opposed to two, for seasoned cutters is easier. The problem is most cutters don&amp;rsquo;t know what they are doing. I think you need to play a lot of Vertical stack to learn how to cut.</description>
