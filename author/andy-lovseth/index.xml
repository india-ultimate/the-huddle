      <description>It was late 2007, and Western Washington University was fielding an alumni team at the Sundodger Invitational. It was early on Saturdayâ€”round one or two, and I believe we were playing Simon Fraser University. A nice group of lads if ever I&amp;rsquo;d seen. They had just put a goal in, and I was trotting back to line with Dave Bestock, Ben Wiggins, and Aly Lenon, among others.
When we arrived to the line, Aly tells me to call a line.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s nothing worse than calling a line a finding an uninvited guest has wandered onto the field. Not only do you have to recall the correct name, but you have to break the news to the overzealous player and watch them slink off sadly like Charlie Brown after failing to kick that football. Rats.
To avoid this situation you must speak with the uttermost clarity and amplification. You mustn&amp;rsquo;t slur your speech; too often names like Sean and John or Brett and Bren become confused.</description>
