      <description>Every team has its own style of play and I think it is hard to pick out characteristics that make a great defensive handler—or any other position—without considering it in the context of a specific team. That said, I have noticed that good defensive lines are able to use the chaos of a turn to their advantage. Some teams try to pick up the disc right away and move it quickly to make it difficult for the other team to set up a defense while others take their time to set up an organized offense.</description>
