      <description>1st: Narrow the gap between you and your defender and engage him. If you get him on his heels then you can cut where ever you please.
2nd: Clear Out! It is much easier to cut from the side positions in the horizontal, as long as the middle is vacated. Make room for your teammates to get open.
3rd: Become a side cutter. Observe the field see who is going to get the disc, get your self out of the way and be aware of where your defender is.</description>
