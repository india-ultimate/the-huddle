      <description>The opportunity to be successful in the face of difficult odds is created long before you&amp;rsquo;ve been put in to that situation. It is an attitude that is built in practices, team meetings, and work-outs from the beginning of the season. The focus needs to be on what you and your team have control over in any given moment. Things that you do not have control over include the score of the gameâ€”those scores are now part of the past and we are unable to have any affect on it.</description>
