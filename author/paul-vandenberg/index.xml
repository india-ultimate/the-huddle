      <description>Hailing from Paideia I probably started throwing a frisbee earlier than most. In 4th grade I was learning push passes, thumbers, and scoobers from Coach Baccarini in addition to the more conventional flicks, backhands, and hammers. As soon as I picked up a disc I wanted to know how I could throw farther, faster, and better. But it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until my senior year in high school that I was able to figure out how to throw deep with consistency from both the backhand and forehand side.</description>
