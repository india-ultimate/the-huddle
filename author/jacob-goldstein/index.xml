      <description>Rotating the mark is a very effective strategy in forcing teams into difficult situations. This strategy works especially well in windy conditions or against teams that primarily run a vertical stack. I am sure that other authors will talk about the mechanics of the thrower in this situation but the one thing that I want to emphasize in this situation is the role of the cutter (normally a handler) who is in the dump position.</description>
