      <description>The impact of the sideline is most important when the team is on defense. In ultimate, as in most possession style games, the offense has a distinct advantage. The offense is in control of where the future will take place on the field and therefore offensive players are ABLE to be a step ahead of the defense at all times. It is the job of the defenders to constantly anticipate where the thrower would like to throw and when those spaces will be available, while at the same time making decisions to force blocks.</description>

      <description>I am not going to write about history. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to write of how &amp;ldquo;zealots&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;RSDers&amp;rdquo; alike bake their theory cake and top it with a little Spirit icing so everybody thinks it will taste sweet. If I am going to talk about it, it&amp;rsquo;s going to be about me and what I think, so here goes:
Spirit is respect. Respect for your opponent, respect for the situation, and respect for right to play this game at any level you want.</description>
