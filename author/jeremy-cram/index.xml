      <description>The most important part of throwing for distance is learning to do so while facing a mark. It&amp;rsquo;s easy for many players to throw 40+ yards unmarked, but when someone&amp;rsquo;s standing in front of you, it becomes much more difficult.
Begin your backhand motion with your hips and follow through with your shoulder and arm. I&amp;rsquo;m a proponent of bringing the disc straight from the wind- up point to the release point, as opposed to a more arced path.</description>
