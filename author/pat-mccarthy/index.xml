      <description>Nearly every team I&amp;rsquo;ve played on had what I would call the &amp;ldquo;traditional&amp;rdquo; ultimate warm up. You jog/plyo/stretch in some combination, and then you do some set of drills which can be roughly summarized as: the down field under &amp;ldquo;cutting&amp;rdquo; drill (Go To, etc), the dump/swing/continue &amp;ldquo;handler&amp;rdquo; drill and the huck drill. There are lots of different flavors of them, with or without marks, where you start, etc, but at their core, these drills focus on 2 or 3 players while everyone else is watching.</description>

      <description>Team defense starts when you can make solid assumptions about what your teammates will and will not allow. A good team defense limits the offense&amp;rsquo;s options to looks that the D is prepared for, and then pounces when the O predictably does what you set them up for. Basically, you can&amp;rsquo;t play team defense if you are purely reactive to the offenseâ€”you have to have a general goal for how you are going to manufacture turnovers.</description>
