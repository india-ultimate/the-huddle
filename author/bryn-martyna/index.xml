      <description>If I was teaching a young player to learn to cut from the &amp;ldquo;hot&amp;rdquo; or iso&amp;rsquo;ed positions in the middle of a horizontal stack, I would emphasize a few keys points, which are generally applicable to getting open on a stopped disc within any offensive structure, but are particularly important for a horizontal offense. The points I make are assuming that the defense is not poaching, as cutting against a poaching defense would require a more in-depth discussion of how to run a horizontal offense in general.</description>
