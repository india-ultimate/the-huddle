      <description>Goal line cutting starts with decisiveness and ends in gloryâ€”either for your or your teammates.
When your team moves into its red zone offense, begin by moving quickly into position. Your speed getting into position will determine whether they are going to stay with you or leave you and poach the lane. When you sprint to your attack point, your defender will instinctively feel like you are a threat and attempt to stay with you.</description>
