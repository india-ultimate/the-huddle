      <description>Catching a 50/50 disc is not an exact science just like every other aspect of Ultimate and unfortunately there aren&amp;rsquo;t a lot of aspects you can practice if you&amp;rsquo;re looking to sky the best receivers in the game. Superior athleticism and your ability to read the disc almost always win. However, there are a few things (besides improving vertical leap, experience, etc.) that can set you apart from the rest of the pack if you want to have an advantage at catching a disc over someone of similar or greater ability.</description>
