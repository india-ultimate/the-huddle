      <description>Good field vision can be described as a contrast between being somebody with good field sense and somebody who has &amp;ldquo;visionary throws.&amp;rdquo; If you have ever been called &amp;ldquo;visionary&amp;rdquo; I bet that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a compliment.
Most of the time people who are described as having good field vision are players who have a general sense of what is going on with all 14 players on the field. This is broken down into four things: a good understanding of passing lanes, a strong mastery of various throwing skills, a knowledge of what the offensive system is trying to attack and what the defense is currently doing to stop that attack.</description>
