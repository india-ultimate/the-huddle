      <description>Three of the handiest attributes a deep receiver can have are speed, jumping ability, and height. Sadly, even by lifting, doing plyometrics, and running sprints, an athlete and only increase her or his speed and explosiveness to a certain extent.

Fortunately, there are several other factors that go into being an effective deep threat, all of which are much more learnable.</description>
