      <description>I have a fairly low tolerance for good defenders getting beat. On the other hand, I&amp;rsquo;m always telling my girls (until I&amp;rsquo;m blue in the face) that the offensive player always has an advantage because she always know where she&amp;rsquo;s going to cut, and the defensive player is always a step behind. That being said, I&amp;rsquo;m always going to put my best defender on the other team&amp;rsquo;s best offensive threat, unless there&amp;rsquo;s a reason that I don&amp;rsquo;t want that matchupâ€”be it height, or speed, or whatever.</description>
