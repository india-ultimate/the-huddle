      <description>Why have some teams (in both college and club) been around for years while others fade in and out of existence, emerging with new names and members every year? What seems to be true is that teams with strong identities have more fun, are more dedicated, stick around longer and play better. The teams that donâ€™t will fight, argue and fade away. What do you think about as a leader and team member of a team struggling to exist?</description>
