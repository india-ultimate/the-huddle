      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve all been there before. The throw goes up, the disc catches some wind, and just hangs. As the intended offensive receiver, you are forced to slow down and track the path of the disc.

Soon it&amp;rsquo;s time to jump for the disc and hope everything works out.</description>
