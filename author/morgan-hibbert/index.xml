      <description>When it comes to catching a floating 50/50 disc, one of the most important things to think about is that if the other person is going to get the disc then at least make them make a play. Force them to make a great play to catch it, don&amp;rsquo;t let it be easy. This philosophy most directly applies to playing defence, but still applies to offensive situations.
Too often I see players setting up position behind their opposition.</description>
