  "content": "We all know how exciting it is to play Ultimate, and we all know what it feels like to have those butterflies before game time. Having a well executed pre- game warm-up can literally mean the difference, in my opinion, between winning or losing the game. Setting the appropriate tone for game time is essential because this game we play is at least 80% mental. Here are a few things to keep in mind when you are creating a warm-up:\nDynamic Warm-up is the key: The warm-up is not just drills, it is also jogging, plyos, stretching, throwing, and logistics (flipping, changing jerseys, eating that wonderful Gu). Many elite club teams have moved, in the past few years, to a dynamic warm-up. I completely agree with this move, and it can be awesome if you do it right. A dynamic warm-up incorporates getting your heart rate up, stretching, and plyos all together. Most teams follow a set pattern of plyos (ex. butt kickers, lunges, frankensteins, and many more) and once your team learns the exercises it can be very easy to run. My team would also use this time to focus and visualize about personal goals for that game. I think for most teams the dynamic warm-up works better than static stretching because it is less time consuming and incorporates more movement into your warm-up.\nFind your fire and stick to it: Every team that I have ever played on has drills that they excel at. It depends on the personality of your team and what kind of players you have. For some, it is a D drill and for some it is a simple box drill. The key is finding drills that will fire up your team, but also get you game ready. Look for drills that are not too complicated, ones that get many repetitions in (as opposed to standing in lines) and ones that mimic game time motions (like cutting, throwing with a mark, and defense). I say develop an arsenal of 5-6 drills that work well for your team and then you can choose 3-4 of them to do before a game (if it is your warm-up before your first game of the day). This could differ depending on weather conditions, what team you are playing, and how late it is in the tournament. The important thing is that everyone on the team is comfortable and confident in the drills you choose. By doing this, you will find that your team will be more fired up and focused to do the drills, and therefore more game ready!\nLeave strategy for another time: Almost all elite teams have a strategy plan for each of their opponents. This could include different team goals, different defenses they will run, or key match-ups. In my opinion, all of that should be discussed at a team meeting at a different time then your pre-game warm-up. I personally like doing it the night before you play that team because it gives your players time to mentally prepare. I think it is totally fine to re-visit your team goals for the game before you start, but the logistics about the other team should be dealt with at another time. Pre-game warm-up is about your team – don’t let it get clouded by worrying about the other team’s best player or how good they look doing their drills right before your game.\nAllow time for individual needs: One thing that Schwa did that worked really well is that we had a set warm-up time. Everyone knew it, and everyone committed to it. It also meant that if you had things you needed to do – the rule was do them before our team warm-up starts. That means if your warm-up starts at 8:00am, but you know you need to get your ankle taped, mix your Citomax, and go hug your friend on the other team, then that means you start that process at 7:40am. By doing this, players won’t be worried about the things they need to do and they aren’t feeling rushed. It allows the whole team to be more present during the warm-up. Everyone has different things they need to do to get themselves ready for a game, but it is also essential that your team find their flow together. By committing to the team warm-up, you can achieve this.\nThe bottom line is that you have to find what works for your individual team. Some players need intensity, some need defense, some need focused throwing, and some need it to be light-hearted. We all get fired up in different ways. Take input from your team and mold your warm-up to what it needs to be to fit the needs of your specific players. Remember, it WILL set the tone for your game whether you like it or not, so choose wisely. Finally, don’t forget to put a stellar D drill in there because we all know defense wins games :)\n"

  "content": "The pre-game warmup can take on any number of forms, and I have seen successful routines span a huge range, from individual to team wide and from fully choreographed to ad hoc. In all cases, the general goal of the warmup should be to get the body ready to perform at a peak performance. This will require people to exert some energy, get a light sweat on and get the muscles firing, and should also include a few throws to help players calibrate to the conditions.\nOne critical aspect to the chosen approach is that the team recognizes the value and feels that the team gets best prepared to play through the selected method. As a team, this buy-in to the method used will make a huge difference in how mentally prepared the team is to play their best. The successful Condor teams I played on derived strength from getting to the fields, doing plyometrics as a group, and running through a few drills together. A lot of the confidence in this approach came from the work some players did with trainers. Jam teams that I played on also had a strict routine that players enjoyed, involving plyometrics and drills, as well as a consistent playlist that helped serve as a countdown to gametime. My interaction with players from DoG revealed that they took pride in warming up individually, putting the responsibility on each player to do what they needed to do to get ready. I’ve seen other teams use half-field scrimmages to get the team warm and in game mode.\nOne issue that can occur is an overworking of the body in warmups. In ultimate you usually have 3-4 games per day. At nationals there may be over an hour between games, and so you have to figure out how to get your body ready without exhausting yourself with a difficult regimen of exercises. In really hot weather, a warmup for a second or third game may only consist of a couple plyos and maybe a sprint or two. In cold weather, an extended jog just to get the muscles loose may be required before an active warmup. Understanding your body, and the condition of the team, will help determine how to to adjust warmups to the conditions.\nThis diversity of successful approaches to pre-game warmup indicates that there may not be a single, superior warmup method. Certainly understanding the basics of what is needed in a warmup, how to create and tailor a routine to match the needs of an individual or team will determine what you or your team does pre-game. Getting support from the whole team that the chosen approach, while maybe not best for each individual, does the best job of getting the whole team ready for the first pull is a critical component of a successful pre-game warmup.\n"

  "content": "There are many strategies for trying to prepare your team to get properly warmed up. I will hit on the main scenario for pre-game warm-up- preparing for the first game of the day.\nMost teams have their own set warm-up that they perform; however, in my opinion the overall goal for warming up before the first game of day should be to get everyone’s body and mind ready to compete at its peak level. The problem with that is with a team of 25+ players, all those bodies and brains react to stimuli differently. Due to this, team leaders should always be open to allowing teammates to deviate from the set warm-up if it better prepares that player for action. Most teams allot about an hour of time for a proper first game warm-up, so that means you should try and get your team to the fields about 75-80 minutes before the round starts to allow for everyone to cleat up, slather on some sun-screen, and toss around the Frisbee to feel the wind.\nOnce you get everyone rounded up, I always think it’s a good idea to give about five minutes for everyone to mentally prepare for the game at hand. There are various mental exercises that can be performed, but my overall goal during this time is typically to have players envision being successful (getting a D, catching a goal, throwing an assist, breaking the mark, storming the field, etc). The mental preparation can be at the beginning of the warm-up or at the end of the warm-up right before the game, my personal preference is to have it at the beginning because I feel the team is usually more focused for the hour leading up to the game. After the brain exercises, some form of cardio (extended jog) is good to get the blood flowing and the muscles ready to go into some stretching.\nSome form of dynamic stretching is then the next step: recent studies state that dynamic stretching (high knees, butt kicks, lunges, shuffles, etc.) is a preferred method to properly get the muscles fully prepared for intense movement; however, some players still prefer static stretching. After getting a good stretch, to further assist the muscles in getting fully prepared for game like movements, I like to do multiple progressive cross-field sprints that culminate in a full sprint.\nAfter the stretch/cross-field exercises, it’s good to allow everyone to get some liquids (water or drink-ade) and eat some food. The next 10-15 minutes are usually occupied by some drills that will prepare your team for the upcoming game; throwing drills that incorporate game time cuts, and marking drills that focus on not getting broken. Ideal drills don’t involve lots of standing around allowing muscles to get cold. After going through a couple drills, it is always good to get in a short scrimmage so that come point one in the game, everyone has already gone through game-time situations at game- time speeds. In my opinion, the opponent’s end zone is where most turnovers occur due to the field space being minimized, so I look to practice a few end zone sets during this scrimmage time.\nAfter a good intense scrimmage, I usually allot about five minutes for free time so that players can practice aspects of their game (pulling, hucking, three-man mark) or better prepare themselves for the game ( additional time to stretch, additional mental exercises, etc.). Last but not least, the final five minutes are used to bring the team together to discuss strategy (Is it windy? Are we going to run zone? Do we need to be ready for zone? What players do we need to identify, and what are their strengths that we need to take away? Is this a physical team?). Once all those things are completed, it should be game-time!\nFor me, the key aspect to a successful warm-up is having a set routine that the entire team knows and is comfortable with and that maximizes your time before a game. However, you should always be dynamic and ready to alter your routine to change if the conditions call for it. Below is a quick timeline of a generic pre-game warm up.\n755-800: Mental preparation 800-810: Jog 810-825: Dynamic Warm-up \u0026amp; Cross-field 825-830: Drill (Throwing) 830-835: Drill (Marking) 835-850: O v D scrimmage 850-855: Free time (pull, eat, drink, rest, shade, etc.) 855-900: Strategy discussion 900: Game-time "

  "content": "You show up early.\nYour team has a routine: a slow jog to get the blood flowing, the usual dynamic warm-up routine. From there, you move into the handful of drills you always do, working out the kinks, getting ready for prime time. Sound like the warm-up you know and love?\nWhile this is the current paradigm, I believe there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of room for continued innovation. Dynamic (active) warm-ups have become the norm over the past decade, but the next step is to make your dynamic warm-up more\u0026hellip;dynamic.\nProgression is a fundamental component of any training program – add weight. Do more reps. Work on less rest. Why, then, do we keep the same old tired warm-up routine? Eric Cressey, a forward thinker in athletic development, changes up the mobility drills his athletes do to warm- up on a weekly basis.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not suggesting that you go quite that far. However, given that most teams have at least one player who\u0026rsquo;s really into fitness, you can task this person with leading your warm-up and mixing it up every so often (or if you have a couple, let them each audition their ideas in turn on the team). Okay, you still want stability and familiarity for your pre-game warm-up; make things more routine over a couple weeks\u0026rsquo; practices before the tournament.\nRoutine is great in that it lightens the cognitive load of what you’re doing, allowing you to focus on your mental game, execution, and the big picture, rather than losing the forest of a tournament for the trees of how to place your feet. However, when it comes to your body, routine breeds stagnancy. Yes, dynamic warm-ups are better than static stretches after the long jog. However, by doing the exact same knee pick-ups and butt-kick runs over and over again, your body will fall into a rut, forgetting the whole wide range of motion it hasn\u0026rsquo;t been exploring otherwise, and you’ll be leaving some of your still- dormant athleticism on the table when you step onto the field.\nSome examples and ideas for you:\nStretching the hips: One of the few areas that needs actual stretching in most. You can do this with a Warrior Stretch if you like; more dynamic forms include the rocking rectus femoris stretch, or even a walking lunge with overhead reach.\nGluteal activation: This is something I don\u0026rsquo;t see teams doing much of at all, much less progressing in. Start with the cook hip lift or bilateral glute bridgesomewhere between loosening up the hips but before extended lunging or build-up runs. Progress to a one-foot-elevated glute bridge to really get your butt working for you.\nOther hip mobility drills allow you to really work a lot of variety in; pick a couple and rotate which you do as you go.\nLow and high hurdle walks (pretend there\u0026rsquo;s a hurdle) Lateral lunges (Progressing from lateral squats) Rotational lunges (Progressing from rotational squats) Walking spider-man (You can add a knee pick-up, inside elbow drop, or overhead reach as you please) Reverse lunge (You can add a torso rotation, or progress to a walking version) Cradle walks (You can add a toe rise for ankle mobility) Walking heel to butt (Ditto on the toe rise - and of course, you can progress to a running version as well) Hamstring work\nSingle leg RDLs (which you can do standing, forward, backward,alternating with lunges on the same leg\u0026hellip;) Inchworms (try it with only one leg down, or at angles other than straight ahead, working your hands farther past overhead to work your core) Frankensteins (again, these can be done standing or walking). Ankle mobility\nRocking ankle mobilization Leg swings (check the non-swinging leg) Shuffles, cariocas Toe and heel walks Upper body and core warm-up: There are options here too. You can work it in to the lower body work (think about adding a T push-up or arm- or foot-elevated planks to add complexity at the bottom of lunges or inchworms; consider adding overhead reaches from the bottom position of any of the lunge variations).\nThis list is by no means exhaustive. think about the many different body-weight exercises you can do for training, cut back from the normal workout volume, try new combinations, and turn them into a warm-up that limbers you up and continues to challenge your body on a daily basis. Like many changes, the prospect can seem more daunting than the reality. Start with what you can manage - mixing up the various lunges, trying a new exercise each week and rotating out one you’ve become too accustomed too.\nThere’s an ever-growing world of possibility that exists out there when it comes to fitness. A \u0026ldquo;warm-up\u0026rdquo; can be so much more than just getting the blood flowing!\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s more, the bodily work is perhaps the easier component of your team’s preparation to work on. Here\u0026rsquo;s a thought exercise for you: while there\u0026rsquo;s plenty of room to add a degree of planning and progression to the physical warm-up, there\u0026rsquo;s even MORE potential for you to continually challenge your team with a progression of the drills and skills you do. As your team continues to gel and hone skills over the season, is it enough simply to run your warm-ups and drills the same way as always, or can you nudge yourself to greater heights with more modifications?\n"

  "author": "Melissa Witmer",
  "issue": "033",
  "content": "The number one mistake teams make in their pregame warmup is too much focus on the muscles and cardiovascular system and too little focus on the nervous system. There is too much focus on volume and too little focus on intensity of movement.\nLast year when I was coming out of retirement I enlisted the help of some speed and agility training professionals. These guys specialize in training football players for the combine. I had an hour session with them once a week for six weeks. The first session I was shocked by how little warmup they had me doing before we went into trials of sprint starts. The first exercises in the session was always sprinter stance starts. Starting from a stationary position and accelerating as quickly as possible is a fairly intense activity. This was preceded by a warmup that took less than 8 minutes total. Most surprisingly this warmup did not literally warm me up. There was little sweating involved. There was no stationary biking, jump rope, slow jog, or jumping jacks. We skipped all of that and went straight into the exercises that would be familiar to most teams doing dynamic warmups. The difference was that they were done for distances of 10 yards or 15 yards, not 25 yard endzone’s worth. The second, and most important difference was that there was sufficient time between plyos (high knees, but kicks) for sufficient recovery.\nThe Physical Components of a Warm Up Getting ready for sprinting is more about preparing the nervous system than it is about preparing the muscles. The nervous system is what gets your muscles firing in a coordinated manner. To get ready to play all out first point, the nervous system has to be excited and ready to go.\nWhat I often see at tournaments are teams doing iterations of shuffles, cariocas, butt kicks, high knees, etc. with little rest between exercises. If players are going a full 25 yards, by the end there is no way they are moving at full intensity and full speed. Athletes might worry that it’s a sign of weakness to take a break between warm up exercises but think about what it is you are trying to accomplish. You want to be ready for explosive movements and quick feet. If you do your warm up exercises under conditions that do not allow for maximally quick feet, you are not ready to have maximally quick feet on the field. If the purpose of the warmup is to get players ready to be quick, the warmup must allow them to be quick by using shorter distances with more rest. Plyos are not the time to increase the heart rate. This is the time to excite the nervous system and get ready for 100% focus and effort. Trying to do both at once is counterproductive.\nPeople tend to focus on the other biological systems in the warmup because those systems are more easily \u0026ldquo;felt.\u0026rdquo; You can feel when your muscles are warm. You can feel when you’re sweating. You can feel when you are breathing hard. The nervous system is a lot more tricky. It’s not something that’s consciously felt very well but it is what’s most important for being ready to go on the first point of the day.\nThe Psychology of the Warm Up The first time I experienced such a short warm up before my sprint sessions I was nervous. And for the next three weeks I was nervous every time. Then I started to realized that if I could do zombie kicks and not pull something, I would be fine. For the rest of the season if I ever caught myself wondering if I was ready or if my muscles were too tight, I would do a few zombie kicks as a kind of self check.\nWas there anything really magical about zombie kicks? Are they a perfect indicator of readiness? Probably not. the point is, I felt that they were. They put me at ease and helped me feel confident in my body’s capabilities.\nThis is the tricky part of a team warmup. The physical part is important, but the psychological aspect will trumph whatever physical things you take care of. Even if you could design the perfect team warmup up, if players don’t believe they are ready to go, it doesn’t matter.\nThis I believe is why teams focus on what they can feel versus what is actually best for them. I would probably still be the same way if I hadn’t experienced for myself week after week the success of a short but intense warmup before my sprint workouts. But now I know.\n(VIDEO CREDIT: Tommy Riggs)\nFinal Thoughts If you are in charge of your team warmups I’d recommend making minor modifications at first. Move your team toward the direction of doing slightly less, allow slightly more time between plyos, and emphasize full intensity effort movement on footwork (cariocas, high knees, etc) rather than doing a lot of reps.\n"

  "content": "Team Warm ups should accomplish two goals:\nPrepare a team 1) mentally and 2) physically for the game ahead. Most teams perform at their peak if they can use their warm up to feel like they comfortable with their system and their bodies. Any team warm up should include enough things to get the team focused and ready for the task at hand without becoming drudgery.\nThe \u0026ldquo;warm up\u0026rdquo; should generally start an hour before the first pull. That means cleats on ready to run an hour before the first game of the day. Obviously, with tournaments the corresponding meet times may change if games are tighter than an hour between and players are already physically warm. The most important thing to remember is that you will perform how you practice. If you’re casual and laid back in your warm up – that’s how you’ll likely play. Some experienced teams in some situations can flip a switch but don’t count on this unless you don’t care about results.\nThere are a lot of variables to consider before deciding on an exact warm up:\n1. Physical Situation (One game or part of a tournament/)\na. What are the weather conditions?\nb. Current physical state. (Hot, Cold, Tired, Fresh, injured etc.)\nc. How have you been performing physically to this point vs similar situations in the past.\n2. Mental situation\na. What is your teams mental state? (Beaten, over – excited, blasé?)\nb. What is your team working on improving?\nc. Who are you playing and what do you know about them vs. your teams goals and strength/weak areas?\nAssuming that a your team is looking to perform at their peak at it’s the first game of the day here is a basic outline for a standard team:\nSpace Check in – Meet – and huddle. [2 minutes]\nA chance to answer question, How are we? What’s present in this huddle right now? Things that might be present include: excitement, tiredness, resentment, frustration., fear of opponent and many more including things unrelated to the game at hand. You shouldn’t assume as a coach or captain that what’s in the huddle will always be the same and therefore that the warm up will correspondingly need to be the \u0026ldquo;same.\u0026rdquo; Address what is present and you will help your team become more prepared mentally to play. Jogging before you’ve addressed the team’s current mental state can impair warm up and therefore focus and performance.\nPhysical Warm-up (as needed depending on situation). [15-20 minutes]\nJogging, Plyos/active stretching, then Rhythm drill with limited or no defense to get in the flow of moving and executing. The best is usually a simple drill with Running/Throwing/Catching. Working your way up to game speed gently over 20 minutes. If you’re not sweating by then end of the 20 minutes you’re not working hard enough.\nIts ok to have several different Rhythm drills but ideally they involve timing and lots of touches. A double box drill (two discs) with in or out cuts can be very effective for this. You can also vary the box in size depending on the wind. Using a very small box to practice short reset passes in the wind and big box for cutter timing and throwing. For those with basketball experience this is similar in function to a layup drill in basketball. Make the simple plays in the flow of the game as you allow your body to ramp upwards in speed.\nMental check in – Situation – where we need to be strong to be successful. [3 minutes]\nThings that may factor in:\n1. What just happened in the previous game(s)\n2. What are the opportunities for us to improve?\n3. Who we’re playing in this game – what they like to do.\n4. Is the weather dramatically affecting our performance? Is this a field position (Bad weather) or a possession (Good weather) game?\nAll of these things can be considered by the coach or captains – perhaps even before the day starts.\nMost teams shouldn’t focus too much on what the \u0026ldquo;other team\u0026rdquo; is doing as this thinking can put a team into worrying instead of preparing. As a coach, however I will often consider the other team (if I know something about them) and tailor our pregame drills towards the skills that are important for us to focus on in order to be successful. Many teams at the highest level will know the skills that they need to focus on each and every game no matter who the opponent and so can easily just look at which skill needs attention and go from there.\nDrill for focus areas – 2-3 drills with limited time between each. [20 minutes]\nOnce you’re decided what needs attetion then simply drill the skills necessary for optimal game time performance for 20 minutes.\nSome things that you might want to work on:\nShort throws and catches in windy games\nContinuation cutting\nResetting practice\nLong throws in games where that will an important option.\nMarking against a good throwing team or when marking needs focus\nDefending against a good cutting team or when person defending needs focus\nDrill to apply physical pressure on the mark or downfield to prepare for the same in the game.\nZone applications\nSituational scrimmaging [10-15 minutes]\nSimple half-field scrimmage practice to warm up to game speed and practice communication. Situational scrimmaging ( Endzone, fastbreaks or getting the disc off the sideline. ) No more than 10-15 minutes of this.\nFinal throwing/Personal time [5-10 minutes]\nLeave the last 5-10 minutes for players to work on private time stuff - adjust cleats, stretch, Practice pulling and getting lots of throws in the last few minutes.\nFinal huddle [2 minutes]\nIn the final huddle there should be no new information. Players should know who is playing and what they have to do to be successful. If you get to this huddle and find yourself adding ideas – you didn’t do a good job preparing for your warm up.\nThings to avoid in structuring your warm up:\nA lot of people standing in line waiting to do something.\nUnless the drill is specifically because you’re trying to avoid running too much (a la – masters team before third game of the day) while also getting some game speed action in.\nRule of thumb – more throws is better. Two people doing a circle drill and getting 40-60 throws in is far more productive that 20 people each getting 5 throws in.\nEven three person marking with a little running and marking but a lot of throwing is better than standing a lot.\nOver warm-up.\nEspecially true in \u0026ldquo;big game\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;late in tournament times\u0026rdquo; Matt Tsang (coach of Fury) was quoted recently as saying, \u0026ldquo;Ultimate teams warm up too much.\u0026rdquo; I believe this is a function of warming up that goes beyond mental and physical focus and leads to tiredness and drudgery. Be looking for this with players. Also recognize that if the weather is warm or you’ve already played a game or two then a long jog to ‘warm cold muscles’ is probably unnecessary. Similarly – if you’re well into a tournament day – drills with lots of running may be unnecessary and actually impair performance. Under warm-up.\nEasy to do if you feel like you’re \u0026ldquo;supposed to win\u0026rdquo; a game. This can lead to injuries and bad habits.\nIntroducing new skills/learning/Drills into pre-game warmups.\nAny drill that you want to do to warm up for a game should be introduced and explained at practice. Spending warm up time trying to explain how to do a drill is wasteful.\n"

  "content": "A quality warm up should simply prepare the body for the work to follow. What is to follow? A match of our beautiful, dynamic sport that involves sprinting, jumping, throwing, marking and changing direction\u0026hellip;\nOk, so how do we prepare for all that?\nThe New School Warm Up: Pros: The most effective way to prepare the body to work out\nCons: Takes a relatively long time, requires tools, is not flashy\nHere are all the components, in order:\nRoll (foam roll, lacrosse ball, stick) to decrease tissue density. SUPER IMPORTANT!\nStatic stretch to increase tissue length\nNote, in Ultimate, the hip may be the single most important area to stretch. Think about the hips as having four quadrants and makes sure to hit them all! Partner stretches work great. Inside Hip or Groin: Partner Seated Split Stretch Outside Hip or Gluts: Chest to Shin Stretch Front Side Hip or Hip Flexors: Kneeling Hip Flexor Stretch Backside Hip or Hamstring Group: Partner Hamstring Stretch Mobilize or increase range of motion of a joint. Pay lots of attention to ankle, hip and thoracic spine.\nActivate (mini-bands, stretch bands) or \u0026ldquo;turn on\u0026rdquo; some smaller yet important muscles (i.e. glut medius, rhomboids)\nReinforce patterns seen in sport (sprinting, jumping, and cutting and lateral movement mechanics)\nWhat this accomplishes? We have rubbed out the bumpy dense pieces of tissue to prepare them to be lengthened (rolling). We have lengthened the tissue (stretching) and mobilized the joints to allow for greater range of motion. We have activated important muscles and trained our neuromuscular system to recognize and replicate patterns we may encounter in the game. We are warm, supple, and moving well. We are ready to jam.\nThe Old School warm up: Pros: Time efficient, requires no tools\nCons: Fails to address tissue density, tissue length and activation\nThe \u0026ldquo;new era\u0026rdquo; warm up is the most effective way to prepare the body for exercise. Though to some, it may seem unpractical…\n\u0026ldquo;Do you really expect me to bring my foam roller and stretch bands to the field and spend 20 minutes rolling and static stretching before I play?\u0026rdquo;\nIf you want to perform at the highest possible level, Yes.\n\u0026ldquo;Whatever, I am just going to take my team through some traditional cone to cone dynamic warm ups\u0026rdquo;\nThat is fine. Though conventional cone to cone style team warm ups may not be the most effective means of warm up, they do have benefits. For example, it does create team chemistry. Teams look organized and sometimes intimidating if everyone on the team is on the same page as they go through all the dynamic patterns. Also, it may be the best way to warm up when in a crunch for time.\nI have accepted that until athletes become more educated, the majority of teams will warm up this way no matter how much time is available. Therefore, here are a few tips if you chose this route:\nReinforce fundamental linear running/ jump mechanics. i.e. A March, Sprinters Skip, High Knee Run, Starts, Transition Jog to Back pedal to Jog, Approach Step Single Leg Jump – Approach Step Double Leg Jump\nReinforce fundamental cutting/ lateral movement patterns. i.e. Shuffle, \u0026ldquo;In- Out-In\u0026rdquo; Cut , Jab Step with Serpentine Pattern, Lateral Skip, Lateral Cross Over Skip, Lateral Bounding to Sprint\nUse lunge variations. i.e. Spiderman Lunge, Cross Over Lunge, Opposite Elbow to Opposite Ankle Lunge\nUse groin openers. i.e. Squat and Pivot, Squat Hops, Side Squat to Side Shuffle\nPay special attention to hamstrings (especially when deep into tournaments) and hit them from all angles. i.e. Frankenstein, Walking Toe Touch, Single Leg Reach, Inch Worm\nDon’t forget to Hit Upper Body. i.e. Trunk Twists, Arm Circles, Windmills\nBe Creative! Combine movements together to add variety. Ie. Lateral Shuffles with Arm Circles, Push Up to Inchworm to Reach for the Sky, Long Lunge to Hip-up to Tall Lunge and Twist\nHave private time. Every \u0026ldquo;body\u0026rdquo; is different. After your warm ups, allow time to each player to handle individual issues. You should know your body well enough to know what you need to feel just perfect. Perhaps it is some additional hamstring stretches or using \u0026ldquo;the stick\u0026rdquo; on a tight piece of tissue.\nIn sum, Ultimate is an extremely demanding sport. In order to ensure longevity, remain injury free and perform at the highest possible level we must spend time rolling and stretching (decreasing density, increasing length) and taking care of our individual issues. Though foam rolling and static stretching may take time, cause relative discomfort and not look very intimidating, they are essential. And yes, static stretching before exercise is perfectly fine, despite what you may have heard.\nCircumstances may not always allow this prior to every game. If this is the case, use an old school warm up to increasing body temperature, reinforces patterns and gets you feeling relatively loose.\nI have a feeling we are going to be seeing a lot more players rolling around on cylinders or foam and PVC at tournaments. Others may see that guy and think \u0026ldquo;what the heck is he doing rolling on the ground, he looks silly\u0026rdquo; I agree it may a little silly at times but as a strength coach, I love it.\nWhen I see it I think \u0026ldquo;now, there is an educated athlete, good for him!\u0026rdquo;\nPerhaps that should be you.\nBottom Line: high level educated warm up = high level play\n"

  "issue": "033",
  "content": "While others may be more concerned with adjustments for each game, specific plyometrics, or the most useful drills, I have 3 solid beliefs on fundamentals of warm-ups:\nTry to do the same thing for each game. No matter what you may include in your warm-ups, teams and individuals respond well to a routine. This way players don’t have to focus too much on the timing or progression of warm-ups and can instead focus on their skills, body and/or uncontrollables around them.\nDon’t introduce new drills in warm-ups. While coaches and captains may have a vast array of drills that could help in many situations, it is more important to use known drills in warm-ups to temper the mental taxation of pre-game or pre-tournament play. Make sure you learn enough drills in your practices that you have a significant repertoire to choose from in warm-ups.\nWarm up defense and offense. We often focus so much on warming up our throws and catches that we forget to warm up our defense. I think the easiest way to do this is to add marks to throwing drills and to finish warm-ups with some sort of game play whether it is half-field 7 on 7 or mini.\n"

  "title": "We Will Laugh",
  "author": "Ben Wiggins",
  "issue": "033",
  "content": "Within 5 years, I firmly believe that we will look back on the warm-ups we use now and laugh. This isn\u0026rsquo;t true for every team, but I think that most high- level teams are warming up in ways that are more similar than they are different. Team huddle, jogging, stretching, plyos, throwing, catching drills, personal time, huck drills, 7v7, pre-game huddle, cheer, etc, etc. And those combined similarities are holding us back. Before that happens, I\u0026rsquo;d at least like to record why I think we got into this situation.\nThe situation: Many teams use intense, 45-60 minute warm-ups with lots of sprinting and full speed physical drills that last right up until game-time. I am not an athletic trainer or accredited in any way, but I believe that several parts of this routine are probably lowering the chances of our playing our best. So why do we do this? Here\u0026rsquo;s my analysis of why each part of our collective routine developed.\nLast year, your team did W, X, and Y before you played. This year, one of your teammates had a great idea for a new drill (Z) that would add a little bit. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to add something in principal, and then no one has to tell the teammate that their idea is not wanted. With few controlling coaches, \u0026lsquo;mission creep\u0026rsquo; tends to make it easier to add to the plan than to take away from it. With relatively little experience in leading teams in our sport, few captains have the time/energy/experience to look at the warm-up as a whole and say, \u0026ldquo;Wait, this is too much\u0026rdquo;. We need to cut something.\u0026quot; So we add Z.\nA second reason: We see the extremely organized teams running long warm-ups. They tend to be successful. Colorado\u0026rsquo;s Mamabird used to show up to the fields intimidatingly early\u0026hellip;and other teams tried to match them in a misguided effort to take away the source of their power. Trust me when I say that Mickey wasn\u0026rsquo;t tough to stop because he woke up earlier. Heck, maybe they would have been even better with the extra sleep. But we (and I definitely include myself in this) tried to match every part of their game, including their long warm- ups. Mistake.\nAnother reason is that the first time you did Z, it was new and different and brought a little more energy from your team on some early morning. That energy is precious, and the new drill gets the credit. Not \u0026lsquo;any\u0026rsquo; new drill, but this one in particular. So we keep it.\nBefore long, you have 5\u0026hellip;6\u0026hellip;7\u0026hellip;.pieces in your warm-up. It makes sense until you look at it as a whole, and then it\u0026rsquo;s almost as complicated as the game itself. When you look at the whole thing, it\u0026rsquo;s overkill. Imagine at the end of an exhausting tournament, in those last important points\u0026hellip;wouldn\u0026rsquo;t you love to have 20 more minutes of jet fuel in your muscles? Or that much more hydration, or focus, or quickness in your first step?\nOne major difference between Expert and Novice coaches is confidence. An Expert knows when they are doing the right things, even if the results aren\u0026rsquo;t showing yet. A Novice worries that mistakes from the team reflect on the quality of the coach. True or not, this rattles the Novice much more than the Expert. Most ultimate team leaders are Novices when it comes to coaching (if you don\u0026rsquo;t believe me, at least allow me this: few team leaders have had real extensive professional training\u0026hellip;and even less could argue that they have Malcolm Gladwell\u0026rsquo;s 10,000 hours of relevant practice).\nNovices worry about what they didn\u0026rsquo;t do. When your team drops the third pass, does your leader assume it was the mistake of a too-short warm-up, or do they methodically roll this occurrence in with the rest of the expected drops for your team\u0026rsquo;s ability over the course of a day? Too often, I think this leads to a well-intended but anti-productive drive to be at 100% full speed for point #1. This means sprinting like crazy in warm-ups, pushing and sweating until we have already used some game-energy to ensure that we haven\u0026rsquo;t done too little. I think we are routinely burning the lasagna to make sure that we NEVER fail to cook it thoroughly. And I think this is because our hard-working and incredibly dedicated and well-intending leaders are put in a position to make decisions for which they do not have Expert experience. This is why you are running 20-25 full power sprints before your first point of an 8-hour day.\nOver the course of the season, we warm-up many dozens of times. I believe that if you introduce a player to a 30 minute warm-up at the beginning of the season and then force them to go through it every day, eventually their body is going to adjust to need that warm-up time. Essentially, we are spending six months out of the year training our bodies to need that 30 minutes to move. As a pro trainer said to me at his first Ultimate-watching experience, \u0026ldquo;What are you doing? This is too much. Look at the NFL. Those players are worth millions of dollars. And they only have them really moving around for 20 minutes before a game\u0026hellip;and definitely not just before kick-off.\u0026rdquo; Do you really NEED six different hamstring stretches and plyos? Or have you trained yourself to need it?\nI think that elite teams have, however, taken major benefits from these long, plyo-driven warm-ups. Ultimate is played in long tournament days where you have to play well when tired. Practices, however, are rarely that long. Teams that do these warm-ups are simulating longer days by doing a 30 minute plyometric workout before they play. Every time! They will be more ready for the end of long games or tournaments, because of all of those extra workouts. This is great benefit\u0026hellip;but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that you want to do the same thing before game-time.\nWho runs your team warm-ups? Think about that person right now. Are they your in-shape, loves to work out type of person? Do they love writing workouts? Do they get excited about cool new ideas to add in? Do they themselves typically warm up for longer than the rest of your team? I bet for many of us this is true. It makes sense, because these are the people most likely to really love this stuff and be willing to give us their time. We are grateful, and we should be. On the other hand, it is a little like letting the over-eating chef plan the menu. Or letting the OCD gal plan the initerary. Talented, but also the most likely to overdo it. (If I am wrong about the work-out leader on your team, then at least grant me this: for most teams, the person that can just tie their cleats and play full speed without a warm-up is almost never in charge, right?).\nTo do these warm-ups, we give up extra sleep and comfort and energy and time to eat and hang out and enjoy the pre-game time. We give up the excitement of running around for the sureness of knowing our teammates are ready to play hard. We give up our bodies natural ability to cleat up and kick butt at a moments notice (especially important between games) and we give up that little extra boost at the end of the tournament. I think that it makes total sense why we got to this place, but I think that we will look back on it and wonder, like we wonder about short shorts and leg warmers, why?\nI am no expert on athletic training or energy systems. My former teammates will tell you that I despise warming up, so I\u0026rsquo;m biased. If you want my opinion, I think you should try to be at the fields 60-70 minutes before game- time. You should do a team drill or game ~35 minutes before game time\u0026hellip;something that focuses on making simple decisions against a living breathing defender. Do something that you\u0026rsquo;ve done in practice, so it is routine and not stress-inducing. Do this for 5-10 minutes, then take a little break. Then play near the endzone in some little, non-exhausting, 7v7 way for 10-15 minutes. Then take a break and eat and drink a little water before game- time. Use practices to teach basic plyos that can help individuals warm up, and do them yourself to set a good example. Remind players (and mean it) that we should listen to our bodies and not try to play beyond our physical limits. Encourage your teammates to throw or run as they need to be ready to go, and trust them to do this (or don\u0026rsquo;t play them early in the game if they can\u0026rsquo;t seem to get the hang of it). Cheer, compete, and don\u0026rsquo;t worry about the sprints you could have run that just might have given you a tiny advantage on a super-long sprint on point #1 maybe. And play.\nLastly, I think great team leaders know that the game is sometimes exhausting and complicated. Practices (including the warm-ups at those practices) should reflect this. Pre-game routines are where great leaders keep it simple, fun and efficient so that the energy goes where it is needed most: the game.\n"

  "content": "Culture [kuhl-cher] -noun: the attitudes and behavior that are characteristic of a particular social group or organization.\nSuccessful teams, sometimes by accident, but more often by design, share amongst their members a common set of values, attitudes and goals. These characteristics define the identity of a given team, and ultimately create the culture of that team.\nEverything about the actions of the team is a function of these characteristics, right down to the definition of success itself. A team that values equal playing time for all players could consider a tournament without winning a game a successful one…while clearly plenty of other teams would not. A team’s culture helps define where it wants to go and how it wants to get there. Core to the success of any team is an agreement, unspoken, implied, or in writing, between its members on these things. Leading a group of people who do not share a minimum of them in common is both incredibly difficult and incredibly stressful.\nI believe that a team’s leadership has a responsibility to lead the team in a direction consistent with its culture. In some cases (like some youth sports or the business world), it can be appropriate for leadership to impose values, attitudes and goals onto the members of the team. In cases where the leaders function more as peers (as is common on many ultimate teams), the leaders only have a limited ability to influence the team’s culture.\nCaptains can be highly effective leading a team where it wants go, but should be cautious about trying to lead a team somewhere else. If your team of sheep are happy being sheep, you probably will not have much success trying to make them into wolves. It takes a tremendous amount of poise and character for a captain to lead a team somewhere away from his or her own goals, but our obligations as a leaders are to lead our teams where they want to go…or to let someone else do it.\nRecently, I have led two very different ultimate teams. The first played most recently at the USAU Club Championships and was formed through careful recruiting and selection. Its members shared values and goals from day one. The other played indoors in a local recreational league and was formed through a random draft. Its members had little in common other than living in the same general area and looking for a good time on the field one night each week.\nAs expected, the teams differed greatly in many ways. One team consisted of mature players with polished skills and refined personal drive. The other had several players who had never heard of a stall count, could not throw a forehand, and had never heard of the USAU.\nMy leadership of these two teams varied as greatly as their makeups, but one constant persisted. I worked as hard as I could to deliver an ultimate experience consistent with the expectations, values and attitudes of my teammates. On the one hand, this included track workouts, sophisticated defensive schemes and goals for success at Nationals. On the other, teaching basic rules, the shirt colors which could be considered ‘dark’ and the importance of stretching were more appropriate.\nWhile the cultures of the teams clearly varied, my responsibilities as a leader remained unchanged: lead the team to the place that it wants to go using means consistent with its culture. My recreational league teammates did not want to hear \u0026ldquo;Just work harder!\u0026rdquo; any more than my club teammates wanted to hear \u0026ldquo;Well, at least we are all having a fun time!\u0026rdquo;\nA team’s culture is central to its existence, identity and success.\nIf you already have a team to lead, it is important to understand the value and goals of your teammates. For example, what would a majority of them consider a successful season? Going undefeated? Sharing playing time equally? How do they want to achieve this success? Holding shorter practices? Running more track workouts? Partying harder together more often?\nIf you are starting a new team, you have some flexibility to recruit players who share your values and goals. Make your values clear before and during tryouts and encourage people who share your values to come out. In the end, identifying (and leading in a manner consistent with) your team’s culture will have a significant effect on your effectiveness as a leader.\n"

What in the hell are you talking about.\nWell, think about it this way. Imagine if the monkey tried to be the rabid dog. Instead of being goofy, he foamed at the mouth, acted incredibly fierce, and was super aggressive\u0026hellip; well, he would get killed. It wouldn\u0026rsquo;t work. It\u0026rsquo;s simply not him.\nSimilarly, Sockeye did best last year when we were goofy, played with smiles and positivity, and failed when we got angry at each other or our opponents. On the contrary, Furious was best when they were angry and fierce, thriving in that team culture.\nSo, how do you recognize what your spirit animal is? Well, reflect on your season thus far, as well as last season. Remember the games you won? What would you characterize the vibe as? What about when you lost? Nurture, then, the characteristics and habits of your successful moments.\nBut what does nurture mean in practice, and how? I like to use warmups/1st drills before practices and games as a means to set the tone. On Sockeye, where the joy of playing was valued over extreme intensity, we started practices and games with small-sided games that everyone enjoyed. It set a tone of enjoyable competition. On Furious, I\u0026rsquo;d instead have a serious huddle talk begin the day with high expectations, goals, and a series of drills where winning was rewarded and losing was punished.\nFinally, every culture has strengths and weaknesses. The monkey lacks the intensity of the rabid dog, the cobra lacks the playfulness of the monkey, the gorilla lacks the cunning of the snake. Your goal is not to find the perfect spirit animal and apply it to your team\u0026ndash; there isn\u0026rsquo;t one, and you can\u0026rsquo;t be something you\u0026rsquo;re not. Your goal is to recognize that one that creates the most success for your team, and nurture and engrain those habits.\n"

Riot has become a weird, unique, open-nearly-to-a-fault bunch of weenies (young and old) who’d rather drink Dr. Pepper than the beer and wine of Beth Wise and Vivian Zayas. I think this attitude of being ok with change is particularly important when coaching a team.\nYou need to allow your players to find their own sources of culture each season. From one year to the next, you may find yourself nurturing a completely different development of team culture based on the events in the lives of your team members. At times, you may not even agree with the development of a cultural practice (wearing eye black or skirts, swearing in your cheers or your huddle talks…) but you have to listen to your teammates/players to figure out what is working for them. If you’re lucky enough to stay with the same team long enough, you’ll recognize some themes will never change, even through the practical sways – the Small Fryz will always love each other more than anything else and Riot will always support each member in their individual pursuits even above the pursuits of the team.\n"

  "content": "\u0026ldquo;The very essence of leadership is that you have to have vision. It’s got to be a vision you articulate clearly and forcefully on every occasion. You can’t blow an uncertain trumpet.\u0026rdquo; — Father Theodore Hesburgh\nIf team culture is simply a set commonly held attitudes and beliefs about a team, then the reason for wanting to encourage helpful culture is straightforward: it helps performance.\nAs evidence, here’s an example of a \u0026ldquo;team culture\u0026rdquo; situation that you may have seen or been a party to. Primary receiver catches an underneath pass, turns to see his partner going deep and rips a pass deep. His teammate, though a good receiver with a decently timed cut, is both double covered and running into the wind, so the decision is questionable at best. Despite the poor choice of throw, his teammate plucks it from the heap and scores a point for his team. How the thrower (who is a team captain and leader both on the field and off) responds to this situation is a key team culture moment.\nMany throwers in this situation would walk to the sidelines and congratulate themselves, or certainly accept congrats from their teammates – thus hiding their mistake – and thereby encouraging a team culture of questionable decisions.\nOthers might shrug their shoulders and walk away thinking, \u0026ldquo;Well that was dumb, but at least it didn’t cost us. I’ll be sure to ‘tell on myself’ by pointing this out in the huddle post game or tomorrow night on the drive home so that people know that’s not what we want.\u0026rdquo; Whether or not this conversation happens and how soon will directly affect the message that newer players take from this moment.\nBut what if the thrower sprinted towards his teammate, pointing at him as if to say, ‘Great catch,’ while shouting to his high-fiving teammates on the sidelines, \u0026ldquo;I will play better!\u0026rdquo; It’s not hard to imagine that this radical way of reacting could have an enormously positive impact on newer players, given the proper context and team culture ahead of time. The message here is potentially so much stronger. Imagine the impact on newer players: \u0026ldquo;That guy, (already a vocal and trusted leader), is willing to walk the talk. He just called himself out when he didn’t have to.\u0026rdquo;\nThis is not an imaginary situation – I’ve seen it happen at Club Open Nationals. What this thrower knew was that his vision for the team’s play was different than the play he’d just made. He took that opportunity to reassure his teammates that he wasn’t going to let the successful outcome of this play affect his vision for how the team continued to play. It was a small gesture, and though I can’t speak to the effectiveness of this comment in the moment, I know that this comment stood in stark contrast to how some of my teammates at the time would have handled the same situation, and that was telling about our own team culture. It also shows us what it means to \u0026ldquo;practice\u0026rdquo; ownership over the team culture as a player.\nUsing your imagination, it’s not hard to come up with a dozen other such situations in or out of games. For example, your team is facing universe point after losing the last three close games; a person on your team makes a bad call; players complain about playing time after a close game, etc. In the end there is an ethical, inclusive way to handle all of these situations, and the teams that do the best at handling them will have the most success in the long run. The trouble is, how to do you identify what these common successful beliefs are, and make them common if they’re not?\nSimply put, in a democratic/player run sport like ultimate, you talk about it. In general, the more people you can get involved in this conversation, the better. Teams who buy into a collective vision of hard work will be most successful on the field, and the same is true of team culture. In fact, one should feed the other.\nWhat does that conversation look like? Think of the above, or your own more recent examples, and ask your teammates: how/who do you want to be when we’re faced with this stuff? It can really be as simple as that. What is the value(s) that are important to all of us as we put together this team? Other examples would be: How do captains need to be when we’re in tight game situations? What makes us most successful as a team? How about as individuals? What does it take to ensure that we’re following through on this stuff?\nThen – and this is the trick – you need leadership players that are willing to live out those beliefs and you need people to keep calling attention to them (\u0026ldquo;I will do better!\u0026rdquo;). It’s called accountability in the business world, and the same is true here.\nHow do you encourage all this outside of merely telling on yourself?\nSome ideas:\nConsider having a \u0026ldquo;team chemistry\u0026rdquo; captain or group of people who has an intuitive sense of the harmony of the team (or lack thereof), he/they can be in charge of hearing concerns from players that need to be addressed. Not all of us are equally adept at handling these kinds of people issues. Finding the right person/people can mean the difference between resonance or dissonance.\nEncourage dialogue on the team values throughout the season, not just at the beginning. Though this is especially important during and after the ‘tough spots’ that occur throughout a tournament or game, scheduling regular conversations like this can ensure that these talks happen. Just as you must establish team values and beliefs before the troubled moments, you must also continue to check in when those beliefs are challenged.\nFor example:\n* We are a team that plays hard to the final point – how did we do this game? I feel like we didn’t really follow through as we’d all like. What kept us from achieving here? * We support each other through the game, and I didn’t feel supported when I made that mistake. What do we have to do to get better? Consider spending time outside of scheduled team time to allow semi-organic conversations to happen around team growth in a particular area. This can have the danger of feeling forced, but when done right can really add to the collectivity and buy-in of teammates.\nAddress moments that are conflicting with team values as soon as possible, and even at the expense of short term success. When you drop an issue or let it linger because you’re focusing on the game, you also run the risk of losing both your positive team culture AND the game.\nFind a way to address the \u0026ldquo;bad apples\u0026rdquo; early and often. As captains and coaches, we’re often treading the line between talented but worth/not worth the trouble. What is true is that your team over the course of a season can’t survive more than a couple prima donnas. All-star teams that are together for even less time generally can’t survive with any.\nFinding ways to encourage cross-clique pollination is key to building relationships, whether the roster is school based and in flux, or club based and solid. Being a little forced here can pay huge dividends later. Having teams within teams, buddies, intra-team cross-workouts, etc. can be a great way to make this happen. Never doubt the value of a little \u0026ldquo;meaningless\u0026rdquo; competition to bring people together.\nAs ultimate is a team sport, an essential step to achieving team chemistry is that everyone knows and values their role in the team’s success. If individuals feel valued and have a sense of purpose, they will be more likely to support the goals of the team, and thus create a healthy team culture.\nObviously every team will be different, and so the specifics of team culture can’t be reduced to a few simple steps. With a bit of concentrated effort and team leaders’ committed to a common vision, a positive, successful team culture should be attainable. Keeping it is the trick and the challenge of long term success.\n(Note from author: thanks to Sarah Weeks for Inspirational and editorial assistance.)\n"

  "content": "Team culture can often be overlooked as an important contributor to your team’s success, both in the short and long term. The culture of your team determines what types of players will be attracted to the team, will enjoy playing on your team, and will stick around season after season. There is no one \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; team culture, and it can be defined as much from the actions of a single individual (founder, strong personality, etc) as shaped over time by the collective actions and personalities of the group. Once your team is known as having a particular team culture though, it is very hard to overcome that perception, even once the reality has changed. So it is worthwhile identifying your team culture (real or perceived!), nurturing what you like, and trying to overcome what you don’t like.\nMany aspects of team culture are neither positive nor negative, but depend on individual preferences. Some players want to play on a team that’s known for being hard-working and disciplined, others prefer to be involved with a team that prioritizes having fun and giving people freedom to expand their personal game. Some players want to win above all else; others want most of all to play with people they like. Some people like playing on a team where direction comes clearly and succinctly from above, others prefer a team where there is room for more people to be involved in decision-making. Most of us fall somewhere in the middle on all of these, but it’s worth figuring out where on the spectrum the preferences of the team as a whole lie. It’s a good exercise to do with your team at the beginning of each season- determine not only what your team’s goals are for that season, but what the team’s priorities are in terms of team culture. Sometimes this type of conversation will highlight the fact that the team’s goals and team culture priorities are not aligned!\nOnce you’ve identified what you want your team culture to be, incorporate elements of it into your practices and communications. Make sure to explain why things are being done a certain way (e.g. sprints for turnovers, or taking a weekend off so people can go play at a fun coed tournament) in terms of what you’ve collectively decided is the team’s culture. Try to ensure that big team decisions (schedule, type of offense, etc) are made with fostering the team’s culture in mind.\nFor many of us, playing Ultimate is such an important part of our lives that we can forget that when it comes down to it, we’re doing this for fun! It’s worthwhile then to try to make sure that our team’s culture reflects what we as individuals value most about the game.\n"

  "content": "A former captain and then-coach of mine offered only this advice when I described to him the multitude of ideas and plans we rising seniors at Dartmouth had for team leadership and culture in the coming season: It’s always harder than you think.\nThis message is worth keeping in mind for anyone seeking to engineer or change something as amorphous yet integral as one’s team culture - it’s all too easy to get caught up in the energy and excitement of the season and neglect the grand ideas and notions you have for making this season the season for you and your teammates, to say nothing of the difficulty of managing people in general.\nOf course, being difficult makes it all the more worth doing.\nManaging Personalities - Appear (and be) Open to Suggestions:\nI like to think of team culture as the sum of (at least) two potentially competing energies: that of the team leaders (they may be captains, they may be team veterans - they are the ones you traditionally look to to set the tone), and that of the vocal minority. I’ve found that these energies are typically generated by only about 20% of a roster; the other 80% are willing to go along with the pervading culture. Don’t underestimate the potency of this minority to subvert team culture, and don’t assume that they don’t exist\noftentimes they are most vocal when you aren’t listening. Team leaders would be well advised to actively work to cultivate the appearance (and reality) of being open to outside ideas and input from all members of the team - an insular leadership commands less respect, and therefore less influence, on team culture than an integrated one.\nCultural Considerations:\nThat said, the big questions you have to address when seeking to identify, establish, and nurture one’s team culture are:\nWhat’s feasible? Is it realistic to expect a college team to have perfect attendance at practices? To work out thrice a week? To stay on-point and undistracted at practices and in tournaments? No doubt some goals for the way you want team culture to develop fall into this challenging category. Honestly assess your motivation and what you’re willing to do to reach these goals - it may be that you can only devote energy to one goal at a time, but once one aspect is established, this then builds momentum toward further progress.\nWhere do you compromise? If you cannot realistically expect perfect attendance, where’s the point you’re willing to be OK with? If you’re going to insist on a rigorous workout schedule, are you willing to permit a lower effort level at practice itself as the team adapts to a higher workload? Know where you stand on the trade-offs between reaching your goals perfectly and reaching the point of \u0026ldquo;good enough.\u0026rdquo; You will find this threshold tested at times and you may need to take the process one step at a time if your changes are especially transformative.\nHow do you continually reinforce this culture? Once you’ve achieved your goal - say, gotten team buy-in on regular workouts - how do you ensure that this is sustained over time? This is where the real challenge and art of managing people and team comes into play. Reminding your teammates of the team goals (hopefully your team as a whole has met and established some) that inspire the culture - in this case, a reminder of team on-field aspirations to inspire hard work - is often effective, as it appeals to both individual desires and to obligation to the team; social pressures are a strong force for reinforcing change.\nA Note on \u0026ldquo;Intensity\u0026rdquo;:\nPerhaps the most difficult and contentious component of team culture to establish and sustain is the team’s \u0026ldquo;persona\u0026rdquo; - what kind of energy do you bring to the field? Are you more likely to be seen with a smile, a scowl, a no-nonsense look? Unlike some qualities that make a team, there’s a wide range of individual preference here, and while some teams have the luxury of selecting for a certain personality, most teams are a mosaic of individual approaches and feels for how a given game and tournament should play out.\nIt’s difficult, if not impossible, to change personalities. It is quite possible, if still difficult, to establish some baseline expectations for team conduct, whether they be implicit or explicit. Oregon Fugue’s remarkable experiment in team spirit - contesting no calls - is an exemplary example of this. I don’t doubt that some members of the team were more given to argue than others, but as the thing built and took on its own life, the personality of the Individual is subjugated by the will of the Team.\nSeek out and nurture those Team impulses, and you’ll create a team culture that self-sustains and refuses to crumble.\n"

  "title": "Team Identity",
  "author": "Ali Lenon",
  "issue": "032",
  "content": "Why have some teams (in both college and club) been around for years while others fade in and out of existence, emerging with new names and members every year? What seems to be true is that teams with strong identities have more fun, are more dedicated, stick around longer and play better. The teams that don’t will fight, argue and fade away. What do you think about as a leader and team member of a team struggling to exist? What does it take to build a strong team identity. What are the team building things that you can control and what is out of your control?\nFinding people who like to play together, who want to put in the time it takes to run and be a part of a team, and who are equally obsessed with a sport that is still on the fringes of popular athletics, is the first and probably the most important element of starting a team. While it takes a critical mass of these efforts and emotions from people, we have to realize that as individuals these element are mostly out of our control. If they are not there then it may not be worth spending time trying to wrangle them together. If you have these elements, then the following are some things that you can control as a decision maker.\nBe Inclusive:\nEven if you have a strong returning team it is important to be inclusive, especially in the preseason. Make an effort to make new members feel welcome, show them that it has the potential to be their team as well. If you treat tryouts like a hazing to get into an exclusive club, in a couple years you will not have a team. Small things like learning names and greeting people during tryouts goes a long way to making people stick around.\nBe Visible:\nOne amazing thing about a team is that you have twenty members at your disposal that you can use to make a statement. The opportunity to design something for that many people to wear or do all at the same time does not come along in everyday life. If you want everyone wearing bright green sweatshirts with a giant panther wrestling a boa constrictor printed on the back… make it happen. If you want to find a company that will sew dragon wings onto the shoulders of all your jerseys and print them like they have scales, do it. Even if you don’t go over the top, team gear makes you visible and interesting. Especially on college campuses your uniforms and identity will generate excitement and recruit new players. Take advantage of the opportunity, do something different, do something fun and remember that people will associate your team with your colors, logo and style.\nHave a United Front:\nStrong teams have strong leadership. If you have a group of captains, or a core of decision makers, it is important that your leadership at least seem like they are making decisions together. Even if they fight and bicker during meetings, when they present to the team put up a united front. If you have an issue with a co-captain don’t interrupt them as they run a drill and tell them what you think they are doing wrong. Wait for an appropriate time to bring it up and address the issue. This may seem like a straightforward thing but I can’t count the times in college where captains disagreeing in front of players has brought team moral way down. Being together as captains boosts team confidence and confident teams play better.\nTrial By Fire:\nPeople bond and build trust by going through things together. Sign up for some fun tournaments where you can be easy going and then make sure you sign up for tournaments where there will be teams that challenge you. Fly to tournaments if you have to but also go to some that take a long drive. Some of my favorite team moments have happened in a van driving ten hours to California for tournaments. Somewhere around southern Oregon there is a tipping point. Crazy things start happening and you have to become closer.\nRide the Ups and Downs:\nRealize that high performing groups take time to form. Having realistic expectations of your team is important for its growth. There is a progression that any group which is building will go through. There is a forming period where everyone is figuring out what it is like to be a part of the group. There is usually a rough period where people fight and disagree (this stage is as important as any of the others because you work out some of you most important values during the storm). Sometimes the rough period breaks groups apart but the ones that emerge are stronger. Hopefully you then reach a stage where everyone is performing well and together. Just knowing that groups go through ups and downs can help set good goals and expectations for your team.\nBuilding a team can be hard. Knowing what you can and can’t control make it easier as a leader. Doing it with friends and like-minded people can make it really fun. I hope this advice helps and that next year there are more strong teams out there than the last.\n"

  "author": "Tully Beatty",
  "issue": "032",
  "content": "In 2001 the WUFF Warriors defeated FBI from Portland, Oregon 11-6 at Chicago Tune Up. That win was probably the biggest win for a Wilmington club team since the Slickers defeated NY Graffiti at Worlds in 1993 [one could argue that the victory over Philly in the regional final in ’95 was larger, but I’ll take ‘93]. Later that weekend the Warriors defeated Ring of Fire 11-10; the first win over Ring for a Wilmington team since 1996 [though in ’96 they called themselves En Fuego I believe]. A week a later at Sectionals the Warriors defeated Ring again, this time 17-14 in a game that was never close: Two wins vs. Ring in a week’s time and the first North Carolina Sectional championship for a Wilmington based team since 1996, the Us Against Them mentality was alive and well and producing wins. Obviously, no one embodied the culture of Us against Them better or more passionately than Warrior founder and leader Mike Gerics. Whether it was the black socks, red shorts and black shirts; the Warrior flag; the team name; or the two catch phrases: Battle, and WTMB; the team’s identity started and ended with Gerics. He was the epitome of Walk It Like You Talk It.\nUs against Them was nothing new for a Wilmington team. Before the Warriors, the Slickers did it, and before the Slickers arrived on the scene the UNC-W Seamen cultivated it better than anyone around. For them it wasn\u0026rsquo;t only an Us Against Them swagger; the identity was also largely what those of us around at the time liked to call being Dreader than Dread; it meant being always in the constant huddle. That sense of being was even with the Warriors years later who in August 2002 rode 13 deep in a van to compete at Purchase Cup: The Warrior leader behind the wheel the entire drive, bringing us down the West Side Highway at dawn and in awe of everything he had never seen.\nThe common thread among the three teams listed above was without question an Us Against Them culture. While that works for a while, it can get to be incredibly exhausting and a degree of arrested-development sets in. While the Seamen won at title in 1993, they should have won four straight. In a team life-span that lasted from 1992-1996, the Port City Slickers’ biggest victories were in their first two years: the backdoor game to nationals over Gimme Five Bucks in 1992, and the victory over NY Graffiti at club worlds in 1993. In the meantime they beat everyone they were supposed to beat, didn’t beat anyone seeded above them and chose to jump up and down screaming Swear Allegiance than get any better. In 1996 the Slickers went into nationals in Plano, Tx seeded 3rd out of 12 teams, won one game and had essentially imploded by the end of the weekend. In the estimation of the then captain Ed Wagenseller, the implosion was the result of a group of individuals who were not willing to sacrifice their own personal agenda for the common good of the team. This is where youth and immaturity came to a head; everything from play time to wanting to stay away from the team with family and friends at nationals instead of the team hotel. This divisive behavior led to the ultimate downfall of one of the most athletic and mentally unstable teams to have ever graced the pith in the mid 1990’s. And that individual decision to stay away from the team hotel took us out of our constant huddle and thus set things spinning in the wrong direction. Steering your team in a unified direction doesn’t end at practice, or once you make nationals. Part of your identity is how you go about business once you’re there; this is why Furious George and Fury have always intrigued me.\nBy the time the Gerics led Warriors arrived on the scene and began attending tournaments like Chop Tank and Tune Up and moving away from tournaments like Toss in the Moss, the Slicker debacle from ’96 was not the too distant pass. While you arrived at Midway on Friday, your rep had arrived on Wednesday. At the time, we didn’t hesitate identifying this and we thrived in it. However as mentioned above, it’s exhausting, especially for players not use to the long haul of the open season; and what becomes most exhausting is the doubt: Are we good enough, am I good enough? A late lead over Ring in the semis at regionals in ’01, quickly diminished and we found ourselves playing up from the bottom for the 2nd and 3rd bids. Later that season at nationals, the Warriors upset Florida Combo in the first game, and had to disc to win on the upwind goal line versus New York Ultimate. The next morning we gained short-term revenge on a less than interested Ring, and in a chance to make pre-quarters the next round versus Madison, the dogs were called off and the twelve packs were brought out. What else better than alcohol to assuage self-doubt? When you’re not expected to do much, no one in turn is disappointed.\nIdentifying your team’s culture can be tricky and in large part you can mold around your teams long term and short term goals. Of course team doesn’t happen over night; you don’t go from a collection of individuals at practice 1 to a team by practice 2; you need time to embrace the peaks and valleys as a group. More often than not, a team’s short term and long term goals – setting themselves up for the big let down – can get in the way of [finding] their identity/culture. Returning to Ring in 2007 after year’s hiatus, we stripped down the objective from winning it all, to stopping the other guy from winning it all. It wasn’t a popular change of direction and not everyone bought in, but emphatically explaining your goal is to win nationals can lead to quick finger pointing when that goal isn’t accomplished and you begin to wonder who your team really is. Players develop an overblown sense of what they bring to the table and it rears its ugly when they come up short; but if your team identity is firmly in place, there’ll be no need for such theatrics when the chips fall the other way. A lot can be said for those teams who simply play the game in front of them, and then suddenly, there they are. Having your team put down their own agenda and buy into what you define as your system can be a delicate step, but with strong leadership and clear understanding of what your team is about, that system slowly becomes the abiding culture.\nWho are we and who is our competition: In 2010, the UNC-W Seamen made a collective effort to lose the \u0026ldquo;vs. Them\u0026rdquo; and focus on the \u0026ldquo;Us\u0026rdquo;. We left the effort to sustain the Us Against Them mentality to our opponents and worked on vaccinating ourselves against 2nd tier teams and complacency. We already knew how we would be perceived and received, so we decided to let them waste their energy on it. In turn, we took that inward focus to create a Small Axe mentality; very similar to what it was prior to College Nationals in 1990. As the post-season arrived, we put up wins against UNC; UVA; UGA; Illinois, Iowa; Harvard*, and Colorado. Had we not made the effort to take the chip off our shoulder yet keep the underdog mentality, it’s safe to say many of the wins vs. the larger state school would not have happened. And adding to that, much of our re-focused identity had to do with how those teams faired after they played us. After nationals we were 37-10. 18 of the teams we played went on to lose their next game. The tune was an old rebel one.\nTeams I’m intrigued by:\nNew York, New York; Boston Dog: Furious George; Seattle Sockeye; Riot; Fury; CUT; Wisconsin Hodags; Wisconsin Belladonna; Colorado Mamabird; Chad Larson; Middlebury; Stanford Superfly; Florida Ultimate; Santa Barbra Condors; UCSB Black Tide; UCSC Banana Slugs; UNC-W Seaweed; UCSB Burning Skirts; Oregon Fugue; UNC Pleadeis.\n"

  "content": "Ultimate is a sport of independent minded players—players who like to self- govern—and in ultimate a wide range of personal investment and work ethic on a given team is common. This creates a difficult situation: the headstrong leader yelling about commitment as the fun loving party-captain rolls his eyes. Forming a single team identity can be daunting. The most important step is to get everyone together doing something other than playing ultimate. Often teams try to define their identity in a team meeting. This is fine—if you want a team whose identity it is to meet and talk about your feelings, but usually these meetings highlight differences more than create unity. Instead, throw a theme party. Go disc golfing. Meet at the local burrito joint after practices. Rent a beach house rather than hotel rooms. Work out together. Twenty-plus guys in the weight room at your university’s gym? Hilarious antics occur, freshmen learn safe weight training from seniors, people get to know each other casually, and your team improves its fitness. That team time will lay the foundation of trust on which you build your identity.\nStrong teams weather disagreement. If two players who dislike each other can coexist, that highlights your team’s unity. Try pairing these two hotheads in a drill that makes them work together. You might be surprised to find how well they do when they share a goal. You may need to have the two talk out their differences. When mediating, always put your team first. Remind them that when teammates argue the team doesn’t win or have fun. But disagreement about team identity is different from refusing to participate in team identity. Some players want the benefits of being on your team (usually playing time) yet undermine team events. The more valuable the player with his cleats on, the more destructive he can be to the team energy. Established teams know that these dissenters must be cut or the team will have a frustrating season. If what he wants does not fit what your team needs, then his departure will reinforce your team identity. If your team thinks you communicated poorly with this player, then his departure will hurt your team. So when cutting such a player, make the cut about team unity.\nOne cold rainy April day, the Hodags found themselves playing sloppily against an inferior opponent. Bryan Paradise, the team captain, exploded with anger, threw chairs away from the sideline, forced his teammates to stand, and yelled \u0026ldquo;now we become men!\u0026rdquo; Had Bryan tried that stunt in November, it would have backfired; had he waited till May, it would have been too late. Bryan had the social intelligence, or the luck, to challenge his team in the right way at the right time. That season the Hodags won their first championship. Every team needs a charismatic leader to articulate its identity. When you find that leader empower him to speak in your huddle. He will remind your team why they love playing ultimate.\n"

  "content": "When planning a practice, it is important to think about the personnel and goals of a practice. For instance, a fall practice for a college team is going to have very different objectives than a fall practice for an elite open team. The college team might be trying to have a lot of fun to \u0026ldquo;set the hook\u0026rdquo; with new players and give a lot of reps to players still learning the game, while an elite team is tuning up for the peak of their season and should be focusing on consistent execution of skills. Recognizing the goals of a practice is critical in its design. This brief article will focus more on elite practices.\nEarly in my ultimate career I was exposed to high level college and pro football practices. One of the things that I was most surprised by was that the players were only on the field for two hours. I was used to ultimate practices which went no less than three hours, and I figured top athletes were doing the same thing. However, in those two hours of a football practice there was more attention to detail, the movements were more scripted and the overall focus was very different than my experience with ultimate practices. In short, football players seemed to be getting more out of a two hour practice than we got out of three.\nThis got me thinking more about designing practices for top-level teams. Rather than doing a drill for a mind-numbing number of repetitions at a continuous energy level that prevented execution at 100% speed, what if we did two drills, but only did 6 reps of each drill, and did each rep at 100% speed with some rest in between? The effects seemed to be very positive. The team was much more focused, and it seemed that there were no wasted reps. Further, the movements and timing of drills simulated actual play more closely than the old version.\nSome of the things that were required in order to get this focus and buy-in to this \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; style was a more thorough planning of the practice, development of new, stimulating drills, and finally talking to the team at the start and letting them know which drills would be done, when we would rest, and a general flow of the practice. When players saw that there was a clear plan, with a focus on particular skills, they were responsive to this change and the overall level of intensity at practice improved.\nFinally, we got away from a mindset that a practice that lasted less than three hours didn’t fully accomplish something. If the team could meet the objectives in two-and-a-half hours, then we didn’t need to practice longer. Incidentally, playing with full focus and full effort typically left players feeling equally exhausted after a practice that wasn’t as long as before. Overall, we were able to accomplish as much or more, in a shorter time, and at a level of play and focus that stimulated what was required on the field during competition.\n"

  "content": "Nearly every team I\u0026rsquo;ve played on had what I would call the \u0026ldquo;traditional\u0026rdquo; ultimate warm up. You jog/plyo/stretch in some combination, and then you do some set of drills which can be roughly summarized as: the down field under \u0026ldquo;cutting\u0026rdquo; drill (Go To, etc), the dump/swing/continue \u0026ldquo;handler\u0026rdquo; drill and the huck drill. There are lots of different flavors of them, with or without marks, where you start, etc, but at their core, these drills focus on 2 or 3 players while everyone else is watching. While these drills are easy to set up and run, they are incredibly inefficient from a \u0026ldquo;maximize your time\u0026rdquo; perspective. Even worse, you\u0026rsquo;re constantly battling team wide focus issues in these drills with artificial goals because you really only need to be focused 20% of the time to do the drills perfectly (20 completions in a row then we\u0026rsquo;re done!). Before you know it, 20-30 minutes have passed and you\u0026rsquo;re not much closer to being ready to play. I don’t feel qualified to say what the best jog/plyo/stretch phase looks like, but I can confidently say that the drill aspect of warm up can be much improved if you focus on three main goals.\n1. Get your team Focused\nAt the end of the warm up your team should be alert and attentive. The entire warm up should take 100% focus from every player to execute. If this is all you get out of your warm up, at least you have a team that\u0026rsquo;s ready for the rest of practice. Warm up drills should involve 2-3 players at most.\n2. Realistic reps at the basic mechanics of ultimate\nCut. Change directions. Catch. Set your feet after the catch. Go from catch to a throwing grip. Pivot and transition from one grip to the other. Make clean break mark moves and throws. Cut again. Get lots of touches for each player (in the range of 100) so that everyone is comfortable making the basic ultimate plays that the rest of your practice plan depends on.\n3. Get it done quickly\nThe Drill phase of warm up should be completed in 10 minutes or less. By shaving 10 minutes off your warm up, you save 10 hours of practice time over the course of the college season.\nMy favorite warm up is a drill we call \u0026ldquo;Dishie Warm Ups\u0026rdquo;. They take 5 minutes to run, and each player gets roughly 100 catches \u0026amp; throws, 60 pivots \u0026amp; grip changes \u0026amp; 30 cuts. Each of these should build focus; if your team does one set lazily, or has lots of turnovers, don’t be afraid to stop the drill and restart it. You can easily add a mark to around dishies, or change the distance between the throwing partners to get more variation in your warm up.\nPartner up with a disc, set up 10 yards apart and go 70-90 yards up and back doing:\nRegular Dishies: Complete running passes to each other up and down the field. Try to throw less than 2 steps after the catch (ideally within 1 step). Inside Out Dishies: Repeat with a pump fake to the outside, then hitting your partner with an in stride inside out throw. Focus on a quick pivot \u0026amp; throw. Around Dishies: Partner goes up the line, then cuts for an around throw off of the pump fake. The timing is different on this one than it is for inside out dishies. Take the imaginary downfield look, then inside, then beat your imaginary mark with a quick move to the around throw. "

  "issue": "031",
  "content": "Practice planning can be daunting and it’s often hard to know where to start. It can be difficult to strike the right balance between fun and intense, learning and playing, covering everything and getting enough reps on any individual thing, etc. In my experience, it helps to have a broad, season-long outline from which to flesh out individual practices. This means having a rough idea of all the different strategies you want to cover in a season (specific offenses, specific defenses, fundamentals, etc), and making sure there are enough practices to cover everything (and if there aren’t, then to scale back your expectations of how much to cover in the season!). Keep in mind that you need to save a few practices at the end of the season for consolidation rather than learning new things. I’ve found that it’s better to cover fewer things and have everyone really on the same page than to try to cram too many offenses or defenses in. I usually try to cover no more than 1-2 concepts per practice (for a 4 hour practice- for a shorter practice scale it back to no more than 1). It’s also useful to have enough extra practices allocated for things that come up during the season, for example something you realize you need to work on after a tournament.\nOnce you have your broad outline set, and you’ve decided what you’re going to be covering in a particular practice, then it’s time to plan out the details of how the practice will be run. On Brute Squad we start every practice with a nice long warm up routine (it gets cold in Boston, and we don’t want any preventable injuries at practice!), followed by a warm-up drill that involves throwing with lots of touches, and enough moving around to build on the warm- up. We then go right into a quick game to 3. The goal of this game is to immediately get people’s intensity up and get them into the practice mentality. Jumping right into a game gets people’s minds off of whatever else is going on in their lives and helps them focus on Ultimate. It’s also good practice for coming out strong, since there’s no time to come back from an early deficit!\nAfter the game to 3, it’s time to start introducing whatever concept we’re working on that day, whether it’s a 3 person cup zone defense, or a horizontal stack man offense, or maybe even just a focus on cutting fundamentals. Having a large white board to use to explain concepts is often helpful, but after you diagram it out, you may want to walk through it on the field as well. In any case, keep the talking portion of the practice to a minimum- this is most often where you’ll lose people’s focus if you tend to go on and on about things. Keeping things simple is often better than giving an exhaustive treatise on every aspect of what you’re discussing!\nDepending on what you’re working on, it’s usually helpful to try to break things down into minimal components, and then drill the individual components. For example, if we’re working on man defense, we might start out by doing a drill that just works on proper footwork and staying on the open side of your player. Then after a while we might incorporate adjustments you make once the disc is in the air. Basically, the more you can break things down, the easier it will be for people to incorporate what you’re trying to teach. And if each drill builds on the previous one, slowly putting the pieces together, your players will get to solidify their muscle memory for one action while adding another one. With all this drilling, you can see how one concept can end up taking up a large portion of a practice!\nFinally, you can only spend so much time drilling- it’s important to take things back to realistic, game situations. We usually end practice with focused scrimmages, in which we try to incorporate what we’ve learned that day either by forcing the defense to throw a particular D, or by adding incentives to the scrimmage (for example, if we were working on deep defense, we might use a 2-point line to encourage deep throws). Ending on a scrimmage also ensures that people get a chance to do what they’re really there to do- play and have fun!\n"

  "title": "Minutes Are Precious",
  "author": "Ben Wiggins",
  "issue": "031",
  "content": "Minutes at practice are precious. Here are my 5 relatively simple ways to maximize the amount of growth you can foster from each of your practices. At the end, I\u0026rsquo;ve included an example set of 3 practices to try and illustrate these points.\n1) Use your warm-up time effectively\nWarm-ups take a large percentage of total practice time. To focus that effort, I like to include warm-up drills or games that give a good mental introduction to the purpose of later practice drills. I\u0026rsquo;ll try to use plyometrics or other movements that foreshadow the movements we\u0026rsquo;ll be trying to teach later. I like to start with a warm-up game for many practices as well, and these games can usually be tailored to work with the later specifics.\nWe all learn from our mistakes, and we are very good at learning from experience. Warm-up time doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be focused or consciously driven for the players. As a coach, this is where I am putting drills that can give benefit without being discussed overtly or even introduced at all. You can\u0026rsquo;t expect players to come straight from class or work or their families and act professionally in the first minute. Even pros need time to get in the right frame. But we can tailor those introductions to help the warm-up put them in a receptive and ready state.\n2) Cover topics in multiple practices\nWhen you think about the school classes you have taken: did you spend 5 hours in a row learning math every week, or did you go to class for 1 hour each day? Spreading learning out gives players a much better chance to internalize new strategies or fundamentals. We can do this by running similar drills or situations in multiple practice plans.\nFor example, let\u0026rsquo;s say we have 3 drills that we want to run for ~30 minutes of total time each. Those drills are similar, with \u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo; being a simplified fundamental drill and \u0026ldquo;C\u0026rdquo; being the very advanced application drill. We could run those drills all on Monday and spend a complete 90 minutes on that topic. This would be easy to plan. Players would spend a long time on similar drills, so we might lose some effective time due to boredom. Also, players would only have one night after the practice to be mulling those topics over when drills or done. Which means just one post-practice meal to discuss and no practices that players can come in already thinking about the topic.\nAlternatively, we can maximize those benefits by running these drills in series throughout the week. This gives players lots of time to think and prepare. You\u0026rsquo;ll catch your team by surprise less, which is a good thing with complicated topics. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to show an example of this in the practice plans below.\n3) Focus on fewer topics\nIn other words, don\u0026rsquo;t try to cover everything. Given limited practice time, work on those topics that are most important. If something is not going to give a real return to your team, then don\u0026rsquo;t practice it. Ideally, the perfect team has probably practiced everything at least once, but that just isn\u0026rsquo;t realistic for a college or high-school team. If you can only practice twice per week, then trying to run two different offenses is not going to help. Do one well. If you are not going to use a 1-3-3 zone, don\u0026rsquo;t learn it. Do you really need to spend time teaching all of your players how to call plays on turnover situations? No! Use those reps to teach your handlers how to make these calls, and use the extra rep time to learn it well.\nMaybe most prevalent, in my opinion, is trying to teach solid continuation (aka \u0026lsquo;flow\u0026rsquo;) cutting. This is very difficult and time-consuming to teach. It requires teaching vision and anticipation, which are long-term learning goals. I feel like many youth teams spend massive amounts of time learning how to play flow offense against solid man-to-man schemes\u0026hellip;and then spend their entire season playing against poaching person-D or zone. Those teams would have been better served spending more practice time on zone and learning it well.\nAs coaches, we don\u0026rsquo;t know what our teams will see\u0026hellip;but we do need to give them enough tools to have success. But when you know what to expect then you should tailor your game to beat it. If you are worried about depriving your players of the balanced Ultimate education for future teams, know this: players that learn a few skills extremely well have a much easier time learning other skills at a high level. Players that learn many skills poorly will struggle when they have to learn any particular skill at a higher level. You may be serving your young players better by helping them master a single skill rather than having a mediocre grasp on ten skills.\n(In the example below, I am writing for a team that has decided that downfield defense is their top priority, and they believe that this is going to help them even if they spend less time on other defensive priorities like zone, poaching, etc.)\n4) Eliminate pulls\nThe time between pulls can be a huge waste of practice time. When you add up everything that goes into walking to the line, discussing the play, signaling, pulling, walking to the brick\u0026hellip;it adds up fast. You can be much more efficient by running more game situation from a stopped-disc. Or by breaking your team into 3 squads, and having two teams pulling to a single O-team so that the D can discuss and be ready to pull very quickly.\nPlaying uptempo at practice will ready your team for observed games with time limits, and it saves a ton of time. With that extra time, you can talk as a team about details or run extra reps. You have to play real Ultimate sometime\u0026hellip;save that for scrimmages that aren\u0026rsquo;t focused on a single topic or that are long enough to simulate a game.\n5) Be prepared\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve read this far, then you really care about creating efficient practices. So I\u0026rsquo;m probably preaching to the choir here. Every minute that you aren\u0026rsquo;t prepared at practice is 20-25 minutes from your teams\u0026rsquo; individual minutes that could have gone into becoming a better player or a better team. Write your notes ahead of time. Have a plan. If nothing else, your players will feel more respected and more valued, and they will work harder because of it.\nMost importantly; once you have a good plan, you can deviate from that plan intelligently. If you\u0026rsquo;ve planned for 20 minutes of a particular drill, then you can change at minute 19 for extra time if you think you are on the verge of a team breakthrough. Alternatively, you can back off the pace and re- simplify drills if the concepts aren\u0026rsquo;t knitting together like you\u0026rsquo;d hoped. Or switch topics more rapidly if they are coming easily to your team. Those kinds of deviations are where coaches and team leaders help make huge advances\u0026hellip;and you can\u0026rsquo;t do them when you are trying to figure out the plan during the practice.\nWith those things said, here is my example for a set of three 2.5-hour practices, with the focus being improving individual downfield defense:\nTuesday\n0:00 Warm-up jogging, normal plyos 0:15 Partner plyos: for the last 5-6 movements, one partner does the plyo for 5-15 yards, then turns and jogs 75% back to the line. Partner traces them back, trying to anticipate the turn. 0:20 Water 0:23 General Offensive Drill 1 (something to get touches and work on non-D stuff) 0:33 Huddle talk: Downfield defense We can\u0026rsquo;t stop everything against good players, but we can make cutters less effective by taking away their best option and forcing them to do something else We\u0026rsquo;ll anticipate cuts by reading the field and reading our player\u0026rsquo;s body language. In these practices, we\u0026rsquo;ll be working mostly on reading body language to be ready for the race to the disc when it starts Work on the footwork now, even if it makes you slower in the short-run. Eventually, this will pay off and we will be able to put more pressure on more cuts against better players. 0:38 Defensive Drill A: Intro 1v1 cutting D 1 player from a downfield spot guarding 1 cutter. No disc. Work on lining up correctly, and on anticipating and moving well in the first 4 steps. Drill is over after 4-5 steps. 0:48 Defensive Drill B: Beginning 1v1 cutting D Same drill, now cutting fully. Still no disc for first few reps each, then with throw on the sideline and a sideline force. Stop drill whenever fundamentals from Drill A are not being met. Working up to staying with players and maintaining position, not giving up hips until cutter has determined either in or deep cut. Encourage good footwork, not just whether they get the block or not. 1:00 water break 1:05 Defensive Drill C: 1v1 from Continuation Similar drill, now 2v2. If the first cutter can\u0026rsquo;t get the disc, they can clear and let the second cutter attack. Focusing on maintaining position, lining up correctly on a cutter in motion to prevent either in or deep cuts, depending on matchup/location. 1:18 Scrimmage w/ Focus #1 2 teams, each point starting from the corner cone (no pulling). Each team gets 5 possessions in a row. Defense working on winning the first 4 steps of individual matchups. On turnovers, no fast break (giving extra chances to work on lining up, anticipating and stopping cutters) 1:50 water break 1:52 Discussion with team: What things from drills worked, and what didn\u0026rsquo;t? 1:57 Defensive Drill D: 1v1 Breakside cutting Similar drill form to A, B, C, but from the middle of the field Focus on tracing parallel to cutter, so as to eliminate crossing cuts back to the live side and not overcommiting on in-moves 2:10 Scrimmage w/ Focus #2 (Skip this if you are running long, or extend this if you have extra time) Same format as #1 Goals are 1 point each, but now so are any full cuts that are stopped and the thrower is forced to dump (play continues) 2:20 Cooldown, stretch, recap of major points in initial discussion Thursday\n0:00 Warm-up plyos Instead of jogging to get loose, players are in pairs with a cone on the ground. At 50-60%, one player is Offense and should jog away from the cone and back about 8 times. The defender should try to stay with the jogging player, anticipating the turns back to the cone. Switch, twice each. 0:20 Water 0:23 General Offensive Drill 2 (something to get touches and work on non-D stuff) 0:33 Huddle talk: Downfield defense Repeat major points from yesterday. New point: Understanding which race the offense wants to run is a fundamental. Club defenders get better with age, not worse, because they understand offensive players more and more thoroughly. 0:37 Defensive Drill A in small groups 0:42 Defensive Drill B in one group, don\u0026rsquo;t add a disc until the fundamentals start to look good. 0:52 water break 0:55 Defensive Drill E Begin with a vertically stacked pair from the middle of the field. Disc in the middle. For the first few each, Offense must cut on the live side of the field After that, Offense has the choice of cutting to the break side (basically melding Drills C and D together here. 1:10 water break (this is a high-intensity drill, so we are breaking more often) 1:15 Defensive Drill F Options Anti-Horizontal Option: Start the offensive pair side by side Anti-Vertical Option: Add a third vertically stacked cutter. My suggestion: Do not start by talking about \u0026lsquo;what should happen\u0026rsquo;. This removes their opportunity to figure it on their own, and hamstrings the offensive cutters into a rigid form. Give players a full opportunity to work this out on their own, to be beat repeatedly and then make adjustments. Even young players will figure this out, or at least be forced to grapple with it. Give everyone 2-3 reps on D before you talk about what we want. Then, make adjustments and continue with at least 3-4 more reps each. 1:45 Water break 1:50 Run D drill F again. This is where the coaches earns the big bucks; either increase the difficulty with more passes, or more offensive players, or a handler than can receive a dump. Or, if this is all coming fast, back off a little by doing the other sideline (the one you didn\u0026rsquo;t do yesterday) or doing horizontal on the sideline to give a new look but not increase the abstract difficulty. Do what is right for your team\u0026rsquo;s next step, not necessarily what you need to get to point B before Saturday. 2:05 Conditioning: 1v1 Deep Drill 2:15 Stretch, recap major points, done Saturday\n0:00 Warm-ups: Do same partner-cone-jog warmups, then plyos. Finish with defensive plyos like on Tuesday. 0:20 Water break 0:25 Drills B and C in small groups, 3-4 reps each 0:35 Huddle talk Today\u0026rsquo;s focus: Applying what we are working on to game situations. These skills are most useful in small bursts throughout a point, but when they are necessary they are crucial. Throughout today\u0026rsquo;s games, our goals are: Excellent- use these skills to stop flow cuts effectively and prevent throws (or block them) Great- sometimes use these skills instead of just trying to run faster than our opponents. Get a few stops/blocks using these skills. Good- Notice the opportunities (ourselves, not the coach) for where we could have used these skills. Identify those times and positions, and be ready to get better at using them. 0:42 Drill F (in whatever variation your team plays offense most regularly) 0:52 Game 1 If you have 21 players, split into three teams. Each team gets 5 possessions in a row on O, against alternating D. If you have less than 21, divide into two teams (randomly). Each teams gets 5 possessions in a row, 1 possession each max (after two turns, reset and play the next point). No pulls. Start each possession from the brick. No fast breaks, to work on lining up off of a turn. Special rule: One extra point if the first throw for the offense goes backwards to the dump. Dump defenders are not allowed to poach on the first throw. Continue the play as normal, but add that as a point in the score. 1:22 Water break 1:27 Game 2 Same format as the first game. Special rule: After the game, every player has 3 conditioning sprints. If you successfully stop/defend/block a downfield cut, you get a -1 sprint. [Ideally, a coach or assistant coach is marking this from the sideline and calling out player names when they get one to give immediate positive feedback.]. 2:10 Water break 2:15 Conditioning: Skyball 2:22 Stretch, recap major points of what we\u0026rsquo;ve accomplished this week, done "

  "content": "Everything that happens at practice should be a building block and not an isolated event. You need to design practices behind a theme that\u0026rsquo;s overtly stated to the whole team and repeated often throughout the day. Never let the participants lose track of the day\u0026rsquo;s goal or remain unclear about the lesson at hand. Emphasizing concrete points of focus over the course of practice as well as the course of the season gives your players a measure of their progress, in addition to game-time tools. Here are five points to consider when drawing up and running practice:\n1) When you introduce a concept, tie it to your overarching offensive or defensive theme. Be clear about the exact actions to be performed, and under what conditions. Try to maintain consistency and keep clear delineation between \u0026lsquo;system\u0026rsquo; \u0026ndash; your team\u0026rsquo;s rules\u0026ndash; and exceptions to them.\n2) Avoid switching gears with no transitions. Don\u0026rsquo;t switch suddenly from one practice point to another; if your two lessons don\u0026rsquo;t relate somehow, you can probably save one for the next practice.\n3) Punish for lapses in the lesson of the day, not for every fault. A lot of teams run sprints or have other repercussions for turnovers, poor choices or other screw-ups. If your team employs such a system, be judicious about assigning them when you\u0026rsquo;re stressing the lesson of the day. Sprints for drops when you\u0026rsquo;re focusing on the cutting system or on breaking the mark will distract and waste minutes. Instead, how about sprints for the wrong cutting and clearing, or for getting broken?\n4) Scrimmage with intent. Don\u0026rsquo;t just release the hounds after the teaching drill to go play ultimate. Mix up scrimmage rules in ways that keep the team focused on the lesson of the day: 7v0, half-field possessions, turnover limits with repulls, always starting the disc trapped on a sideline are all tweaks you can work in that will keep players trying to make each other better, and not just win an insignificant scrimmage. SIDE NOTE: Sprints are boring. Can you think of ways to ‘condition with intent’ in the same way?\n5) Review at end of practice. Challenge the players to mentally go over the lessons of the day. Again, when reviewing, place the lessons of the day into the larger strategic concept your team is trying to adopt.\n"

  "content": "Great practices don\u0026rsquo;t just happen. A lot of work goes on behind the scenes to plan practices that run smoothly and effortlessly, as well as accomplishing the main goal of making the team better.\nPlan your practices in advance - not just the drills for one practice, but figure out what concepts you want and need to cover over the course of the season. Then break down the concepts and spread them over the available practices. It\u0026rsquo;s good to pair a conceptual topic, like force middle, with a related skill like deep defense, to break up the monotony of discussing a single topic for an entire practice. When planning practices, make sure to note how much time you want to spend on each drill or scrimmage, then stick to that time schedule during practice.\nWhen teaching a new concept to your team, it\u0026rsquo;s important not to overload players with information. Limit the voices in the huddle to coaches or the person presenting the concept or drill, and make sure they stick to emphasizing the key takeaways from the drill. While other players might have advanced insight, it\u0026rsquo;s more effective to have them talk to the coach separately, or talk to players individually instead of to the entire group. Give the team two or three points to think about when doing drills - any more, and it becomes too much to focus on.\nA very effective teaching technique for drilling a concept or skill is to go through several iterations of a similar drill, with increasing game realism. Start with offense-only, or a 1v1 matchup, then move to adding more cutters, more defenders, more active marks on the throwers, etc., until the drill resembles an in-game situation. This builds muscle memory and helps people realize how their individual motions fit into the offense or defense as a whole. You can then move on to a scrimmage with a focus that makes the team implement what they just learned.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important to keep the entire team engaged during the whole practice - veterans, rookies, and injured players. Limit downtime between drills, don\u0026rsquo;t let people complain about drills, invent scoring systems for drills, and give incentives. For instance, in a drill that works on the defense forcing out in 1v1 downfield defense, give the offense 1 point for catching a deep goal, 2 points for catching an in cut, and 0 points for a turnover.\nRemember when planning practices: Do it in advance. Combine concepts and skills for a themed practice. Limit the talking. Give a couple points to focus on. Drill with increasing realism. Scrimmage with a focus. Keep the team engaged.\nPractice is where the biggest gains are made, and smooth, effective practices are focused and planned in advance.\n"

  "content": "Elementary Ultimate (Ages 8-11) Beginners\nFun, fun fun.\nWhen it comes down to it, these guys just aren’t quite developed enough to hold attention on one thing for anything longer than 15 minutes. So first things first, you really have to chunk your practice out. Secondly, these kids are just learning how to use their bodies in an athletic way and ultimately a lot of what you do will be teaching them overall coordination and control of their bodies. Lastly, you are probably introducing this game to the kids for the first time in the life, teach them to love the game make every minute exciting and fun! Get them started with an activity that doesn’t even involve a disc or involves it but not in a conventional way. (Tag, Capture the Frisbee, Relay races with the disc as a baton).\nNow that they are warmed up and hopefully a little bit tired, this would be the time to teach them in their first chunk, whether it’s throwing, catching or the basics on cutting you have about 15 to 20 minutes. The basic outline of practice should alternate between a skill focused drill and a game that works on that skill. It’s also important to remember when planning a practice for a group of kids this age is to include an activity or game that really emphasizes teamwork, sportsmanship, and spirit. Along with learning the game these guys are still learning how to work with others and how to do it respectfully in a competitive environment.\nFavorite drills/games for kids this age Dog: two players run deep for a pass trying to catch it. Frisbee tag: players who are \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rdquo; work together to pass the disc around and tag others with the disc or by throwing a soft pass at another player for them to become it as well. Played in an end zone. Ladder drill races: team members must run ahead of the player with the disc and receive a pass to gain yards and make their way down the field. Players must throw and receive from the same player, teams of 4 or 5. Potential Practice Plan 1.5 hours 0-10/15min: Warm up game 15min-30: Partner throwing/catching 30-45: Ladder relay drill Break 55min-1hr 10: Basic come to drill 1:15-1:30: Dog Drill Middle School (Grade 11-14) Intermediate\nThis age can often be a tough group to plan a practice for. For developing programs you may end up with a mix of kids some of which have never touched a disc before and some of which have been playing for 3 years. Many of these practices can be run with the same mentality as the Elementary level but with more in depth and intermediate level skill work. For programs that are developed with multiple teams you now have the option to really break the practice into groups based on skill. It is still really important at this age to be running drills that focus a lot on teamwork and sportsmanship especially as the kids start to get more competitive and obtain egos.\nOn to planning, as a teacher I take every moment as a teaching opportunity even if the kids don’t know it. Start off with a proper warm up, jog, stretch, some beginning plyos. Teach them good habits for when they are old because at the rate they are going they may not be playing past 25. From there it is great to start with throwing because all players at this age especially need it and it’s a great time to get your one on one in with the kids. Move on to your first drill of the day, a nice warm up with some sort of game aspect to it or challenge, even though they are older attention spans are still low. For my older kids, 8th grade, I like to have two drills in a row come next focusing on the theme of that days practice, the first breaking down the skill and the second being an application of that skill in a real time situation. I always like to end practice with a full scrimmage, they deserve it and really these kids just need to play, play, play, have fun and learn to play as a team.\nThemes for practice at this level Fundamentals!: Footwork, how to cut, finding open space, proper throwing form Timing cuts off others, Offensive cutting patters, Vert or Ho stack Defense body positioning Marking and the Force Practice Outline 2 hours 0-20minutes Warm up 20-30minutes Throwing 30-40/45minutes Warm up drill/game 45minutes -1hr first drill, skill focus Break 1:05-1:20 2nd drill - application, more game like situation than first 1:30-2hr Scrimmage, Game to 5 "

  "content": "1. Write it down.\nThis helps you remember your plan, creates a document that you can return to, and can be emailed to the team beforehand if you feel it would help.\n2. Specify time allotments for each segment of practice.\nThis creates a schedule, and is easier on you (you know when to start/stop a drill) and your team (they know there\u0026rsquo;s a plan to stick to).\n3. Don\u0026rsquo;t perform a drill for more than 15 minutes.\nAttention spans are short. Realizing this, and not fighting it, is important. However, running a drill for 10 minutes, then adding a new element/twist, can allow for longer drilling on a certain skill while keeping interest level high. Say, drilling a skill first without defenders, then adding a mark, then adding full defense, can give three iterations of a drill over three 10-minute periods while still changing it enough to maintain interest.\n4. Allow for feedback\u0026hellip; after practice.\nEveryone\u0026rsquo;s a critic. When someone tells you how a drill should be run, or why it sucks, remember that they want the same thing as you \u0026ndash; to have the best practice possible \u0026ndash; and let them know that their criticism is valuable, but best heard after practice is over, when you can spend time discussing how to improve or add drills. Giving a critic the responsibility of planning a drill often opens their eyes to how difficult running a practice is, and is a valuable tool to getting them on board.\nIn addition, seek feedback from the team. Ask players what they think of practice, what they want to work on individually and what they think the team should work on. An \u0026ldquo;open mic\u0026rdquo; team meeting can often be a great means of soliciting ideas for drills, for skills to focus on, and for team buy-in. When a player sees the drill s/he recommended use at a practice, they are that much more invested in the drill\u0026rsquo;s success and will show it in their own effort.\n5. Let practice plans come from strategy meetings.\nAssessing the goals, strengths, and weaknesses of your team as a whole can often make practice planning seem easy and obvious, whereas before it seems daunting and complex. Early season? Use practice time to assess your strengths and weaknesses with ample scrimmage time. Mid season? Use early tourney performance to guide what you need to work on and reinforce. Late in the season? Write down everyhting you\u0026rsquo;d like to work on, then look at how many practices you have left, and create a plan for what you most need to work on and focus on that.\n6. Feeling overwhelmed?\nAsk for help. In many ultimate communities there are some really smart people out there that would be both flattered and excited to help you out. Buy \u0026rsquo;em a beer and chat about what you\u0026rsquo;d like to do, and what advice they have for you.\n7. You\u0026rsquo;ll be fine.\nPlanning a practice, then running it, are difficult, and can be scary. When I helped plan and run drills for the first time as a second-year player / first- year captain on Sockeye, I was nervous and felt out of my league. But, after time, and after some successes and some failures, I realized what I could offer and what I should and could rely on others to offer, and established a place for myself as a practice leader. Being nervous means you care; don\u0026rsquo;t let it prevent you from running great practices.\n"

  "content": "Epic rants by NBA legends belittling the importance of practice aside, there is a wealth of evidence that points to the importance of practice, both quantity and quality, when it comes to improving athletic performance. Many people have noted that athletes seem to require at least 10 years from the time they begin a sport until they are able to reach the top of their game. Others have taken this analysis further. Malcolm Gladwell observed in his book, Outliers, that top performers can only manage to practice effectively for about 1,000 hours every year, thus arriving with the often quoted \u0026ldquo;10,000 hour rule\u0026rdquo; which must be satisfied in order to master a complex task. Matthew Syed takes this observation a bit further in his book, Bounce, by pointing out that those practice hours must be purposeful, and filled with failure; simply going through the motions and not challenging yourself to the point of failure does not lead to sustained improvement.\nWhat qualifies as practice is still a bit murky to me, but there are two numbers to consider which helps put things in perspective. First, a 40-hour work week equals about 2000 hours a year. To hit the 1,000 hour a year mark, you need to be putting in about 3 hour days, seven days a week, for a whole year. Second, some very sketchy calculations suggest that during my 13 years playing Ultimate, I’ve logged between 5,000 and 6,000 hours on the field. I think it’s safe to say that a vanishingly small number of Ultimate players have to worry about practicing too much, or satisfying the 10,000 hour rule.\nSo, the question of how to get the most out of a practice is extremely valid. For my part, I’m going to focus on four basic principles to keep in mind when figuring out how to practice, along an example or two. It’s up to you and your team to figure out how to apply them.\nGet Everyone on the Same Page:\nThis goes without saying to a certain extent, and comes in a variety of forms; playbook meetings, moving discs around on the ground, on-field examples, etc. The team should be presented with concepts in a controlled setting where questions are easily asked and answers are quickly given. Simply put, the majority of this explanation should take place before your team warms up, or at least after any substantial breaks during practice. Further, someone should have spent enough time thinking about that concept to the point where they don’t have to think about the answer, or consult the playbook.\nMaximize your reps:\nIn a word, drills. The function of drills is to allow everyone on your team to cement basic concepts and movements through repetition. Entrusting your team to learn by just playing games is not sufficient. An entire game may only present an individual player with a handful of opportunities to implement a certain concept, while the majority of their time is spent between points, watching from the sideline, or executing other concepts (hopefully) to perfection; time which is not spent improving on newly learned concepts. The drills don’t have to be perfect, but you definitely need to think about both how best to convey the strategy you are trying to teach, and the logistics of people moving through a drill in order to maximize the number or repetitions. Additionally, consider making a substantial portion of your warm-ups for practices and tournaments a drill your team has run recently.\nTake it up a notch:\nOnce your team has the basics down, your drills and games need to be modified to make things more difficult in order to push beyond your limits. This is where the aspect of failure as an important aspect of practice comes into play. Only by changing the set-up of your drills, or the rules by which you play your games to make execution more difficult will you be pushed beyond your limits to the point of failure. At that point, every failure should be treated as a learning opportunity. Shortening the stall count to force moving the disc faster, or a designated poacher on defense are just two examples, but there are lots of creative ways to make things more difficult. Finally, there should be sufficient downtime incorporated into a drill or game for people to register mistakes, discuss what happened, and think about alternatives.\nFollow it through:\nDuring the course of a season, there are a lot of things to cover, and there is an innate tendency for coaches and captains to assume that once a concept is explained and executed successfully once, it is time to move on to the next one. Remember, it takes 10,000 hours to \u0026ldquo;master\u0026rdquo; a sport, and the vast majority of that is repetition. Concepts should be serially revisited, and teammates held accountable for not carrying forward past lessons.\nAnecdotally, two months is a ballpark amount of time you should allow for a reasonably complex task, like a particular zone defense, or even a complex set play. This comes primarily from my observation that of all the concepts introduced after Regionals, at most one in ten was ever implemented at Nationals.\n"

  "author": "Melissa Witmer",
  "issue": "031",
  "content": "Practice planning isn\u0026rsquo;t just for the team captain. Every player should take it upon themselves to have throwing practice in addition to team practice. Make the most of your practice hours by incorporating these habits into your throwing regimen.\n1. Choose the right throwing partner(s)\nBefore you can even practice, you need a throwing partner!\nFind a good throwing partner or several partners. If you\u0026rsquo;re serious about becoming an all-star handler, you will probably need more than one partner to get in the amount of hours required. Your ideal partner should also be on a mission to become a better thrower. Your partner may or may not be your best friend on the team. You are not going out to toss around and socialize. You are going out to practice. You need a partner that shares this mindset.\nThe rookies on your team may be your best bet for a consistent, enthusiastic throwing partner. If you are an upperclassman, they will be flattered by your attention and less likely to bail on your scheduled throwing times. Furthermore someone who is just learning to throw will be more likely to have the insatiable appetite for throwing hours that you need. They will make sure that you keep your throwing appointments even when it\u0026rsquo;s rainy or you just don\u0026rsquo;t feel like it.\n2. Warm up\nIf you want a quality session, it will be physically demanding. Killer low release throws require a killer range of motion in your hips. Big hucks require big time rotational forces at a high rate of speed. This is practice, so treat it like one and prepare your body accordingly.\nbasic warm up sequence:\nmobilty neck rolls inch worms bent over thoracic spine rotataion five point lunges airplanes sumo squats dynamic clap pushups lateral skip drop-step skip cariocas 3. Choose a Focus Throw\nWhile you will hopefully be improving all of your throws, I have found in extremely helpful to have one particular throw that I am intent on improving. The mind has limited resources and a limited ability to focus. Having one focus throw will enable you to use those limited resources more effectively. Your focus throw should be specific.\nNot, \u0026ldquo;forehand\u0026rdquo; but \u0026ldquo;flat forehand.\u0026rdquo; Or \u0026ldquo;low release inside out forehand.\u0026rdquo;\n4. Variation\nOne of the most important concept of practice is variability or practice. The more variety the more efficient the learning process will be. Instead of throwing 20 of the same exact throw in a row, you will learn better if each throw is different from the one before it. This is counter-intuitive, I know. But it is one of the most robust finding of motor skills research.\nSo how can you have a focus throw and still have variability in practice? I recommend breaking up your focus throw trials with other throws in between. You could throw three low release backhands, two forehands, three low release backhands, two high release backhand, three low release backhands, two hammers. Using this method, you will still have more trials of your focus throw while still having variability and minimizing the effect of contextual interference.\n5. Visualization\nHave a crystal clear picture in your mind of what you want your focus throw to look like. Many of my signature throws are based on the throws of others. It can help to have a model in mind. Pick your favorite handler. Do you like their low release backhand? See if you can replicate it. The throw will, of course, end up looking slightly different because everyone\u0026rsquo;s body is different. Still, having the idea in your mind of what you want your throw to look like will help.\nWhen you\u0026rsquo;re throwing visualize the trajectory of your throw. Just as you\u0026rsquo;re being specific with your focus throw, be specific in visualizing the trajectory you want. How much angle? What velocity? Where are you hitting your target? Visualize the trajectory you want before each and every one of your focus throw trials. With practice this will become second nature and not take any extra time. Don\u0026rsquo;t spend too much time thinking, the visualization is a millisecond snapshot or film clip of the throw.\n6. Have a pattern to your practice session.\nThis is what mine looks like:\nwarm up mess around for about 5 minutes with whatever throws you feel like. (This is part of your warm up.) Get to work. Focus on the details. This is the time to work on any biomechanics you are trying to change. This is the most mentally challenging part, so we do it early while our focus is best. Conditioning. Here is where you want to get stronger in the motions that are specific to throwing or just gain some endurance. Throw harder, faster fakes. Throw longer throws. Do some give-n-go drills with your partner. Cool down. Decompress. This will often happen naturally when you reach the point of mental fatigue. This is when you’re allowed to throw your silly throws. Socialize a bit with your throwing partner and leave the field happy so that you want to come back for more! 7. Know when to stop\nAs I\u0026rsquo;ve said, the focus of the brain is a limited resource. Engaging in deliberate, focused throwing practice is work. Eventually, your ability to focus will wear out. Don\u0026rsquo;t fight it, accept it. If you start feeling frustrated, you\u0026rsquo;ll become tense and your movement patterns will be affected. Frustration also prevents objective evaluation and adjustment of each trial. If you cannot recenter yourself, it is best to stop and try another day. As you gain experience with throwing practice you will naturally gain a better feel for when you are mentally done.\nHow long this takes is the length of your throwing sessions will also be influenced by your level of conditioning. If you aren\u0026rsquo;t used to lunges, your legs will wear out before your brain. Your shoulder can also wear out quickly if you do too much hucking too fast. For learning motor skills, the more you do the better. However, you still need to respect your physical limitations. Start with shorter sessions and build up to longer ones to allow your body to adapt.\nFinal Thought\nPutting a large chunk of time into throwing practice early in your career will have a huge impact on how it unfolds. Fitness can come and go but motor skills stay with you for life.\n"

  "content": "Practice is a vital part of mastering any skill, and team sports are no exception. A quality practice structure can transform a meaningless few hours running around into a valuable and productive growth opportunity for your team. While the content covered in a given practice clearly varies heavily with the level, division, weather, time of year, etc, some of the basics of running a quality practice are nearly always applicable. Here are a few of my favorites.\nKnow your audience – The frequency, duration, content and tone of your practice should be specifically catered to your audience. The team’s physical condition, level of experience, or even individual maturity can impact what you can cover and for how long. Your group of seasoned club veterans will probably have some patience for 15 minutes talking about the subtleties of a zone defense; your brand new group of high school rookies probably needs a shorter, more simple presentation.\nHave a purpose for everything you do – Demand of your players (and yourself) that anything worth spending time on should be for a good reason. Structure your practice with activities with particular purposes…generally the more specific the better. Share the goal with the team and make it a clear objective. Clearly measurable actions are often the easiest for everyone to keep track of. For example, this year my team was struggling with moving the disc horizontally, so we would scrimmage and limit the offense to 4 throws without crossing the vertical midline of the field. Failure to do so resulted in a turnover. Players on the sideline counted the throws out loud to make everyone aware. The specific, measurable objective quickly opened up our offense and got us comfortable moving the disc horizontally.\nSuccess: crossed midline within 4 passes Turnover: failure to cross within 4 passes [Diagrams by Kathryn Irons]\nKeep things moving – Regardless of the demographic of your team, learning is often best facilitated with variation. Keep your drills short, 10 to 15 minutes maximum. The result of the drill is not as important as the experience. Sometimes letting the team struggle with a new concept and work it out is for the best. Succeed or fail, after 15 minutes most drills get stale and it is time to move on. Take water breaks as a team between segments of your practice, and encourage players to push through the current segment without stepping aside for rest. It is much easier to demand a high level of focus for short spurts than to ask your players to stay with you for hours in a row and self-regulate their attention.\nMind your distance – Teaching and learning is a personal exchange between teacher and student. When it is time to teach, explain, or diagram a concept, bring the team in close and talk so everyone can hear you. When an individual player requires feedback (not to be confused with encouragement), have a conversation instead of yelling across the field. When it is time to practice what they have learned, let them play. Keep your distance and let them experience what they need to. When it is time to teach again, reel them in for a water break and go back to the chalkboard.\nKeep up the intensity – While walkthroughs and careful demonstrations are an important part of teaching, learning and developing muscle memory almost always needs to be done at game speed. Ultimate is played best in short bursts of energy, much more like hockey shifts than a soccer game. Practice is the time to develop comfort with the repetition of explosive output while mastering the poise of executing fine motor skills at that level. If the intensity in your practice exceeds the intensity of any game you play during the season, you are preparing your team well. To allow your players to go through the motions and use excuses like \u0026ldquo;In a game I’d layout for that,\u0026rdquo; is doing them a disservice.\n"

  "issue": "031",
  "content": "It’s the end of the day, and it feels like nothing has been accomplished. Teammates barely listened to instruction, drills were sloppy and unfocused, everything took twice as long as it should have, and you walk away with a sick taste in your mouth, directing your anger and frustration towards the most vocal trouble-makers. That’s right, you’ve just experienced another bad practice.\nWe’ve all had this feeling before, and while you’ll probably have it again, there are ways we can reduce the severity of the bad practice. I think that there are three main enemies which can subvert your practice time and cause your players to lose focus, and they are all (partially) under your control. These three problem areas are poorly chosen drills, lax leadership, and too much wasted time between activities.\nFirst things first. If you are a college or youth team, odds are good that there are not enough Frisbees in the air at practice. Many drills are ill- suited for your needs, and they all revolve around the same theme: two (or more) lines, one frisbee, and lots of players watching a single actor while waiting for their turn. This is exacerbated 1) for clubs that are large or almost big enough to split into two teams, and 2) for clubs that share practices with their B team due to time/space considerations.\nActively campaign to maximize the \u0026ldquo;touches\u0026rdquo; each player gets in a single practice, especially early in the season. Split \u0026ldquo;line drills\u0026rdquo; in half or in thirds to increase productivity. If the drill requires a lot of space, combine it with one or two compact throwing/running/catching drills, and rotate players every 15 minutes. If you have 25+ players and limited space, consider building four or five 3 v 3 fields (30x20 w/ 5 yard endzones) perpendicular to your field instead of a single scrimmage. Invent drills that let you move in ‘waves’ across the field, then sprint back to the beginning, so that discs are always in the air. Split your team into thirds and have 2/3 scrimmage each other or play endzone games while the other third runs a drill, and rotate on the clock. Always be pushing to get more discs and people moving, and it will translate into confidence when it matters.\nRegarding lax leadership: this should go without saying, but if you wait until everybody shows up to start practice, you are doing your team a terrible disservice. As a player, you should ask your friends to come 15 minutes early to each practice to \u0026ldquo;help you with your throws,\u0026rdquo; and, as a captain, start running warm-ups in the first minute of your scheduled practice time. If your leaders are late, your team will be late. Always. Elect punctual captains. Elected captains: create a culture of earliness and refuse to start practice late.\nFinally, if you want to reduce dead time in between drills, you need to always tell your players the next thing that they will be doing. You can minimize that awkward dead period in between drills by planning ahead and by giving a defined break time (e.g. \u0026ldquo;90 seconds to get water, then we are doing a 3-man breakmark drill\u0026rdquo;). Captain-coaches, this means that you have to duck out of the present task five minutes early to set up the next drill. If you are lucky enough to have a coach, encourage him or her to take care of it.\nIf you can get more discs in the air, make use of your full practice time, and always tell people where and when they are headed next (and have it ready for them), you will be amazed at how much more productive your practices are. In my experience, players are generally motivated to work hard, and will exhibit good practice attitudes if you keep them busy and keep them moving.\n"

  "author": "Colin McIntyre",
  "issue": "030",
  "content": "When I played in college especially, my team made a concerted effort to maintain an active sideline and to communicate efficiently from the sideline rather than simply being loud. That carried over in Club, where I played with many of those same players.\nWhen I am on the sideline helping teammates on the field, I like to select one player to communicate with and focus on two things: 1) conveying information and 2) being specific. Anyone on the sideline can be your cheerleader. As your sideline teammate, my goal is to help you play better Ultimate by providing you with an extra set of eyes and ears and a constant flow of information. In general, I talk more to teammates on D than O, and though my comments below focus on man defense, the basic theme applies to zone also.\nFirst, I concentrate especially on conveying information that you cannot easily obtain yourself. Generally, this means watching the thrower (and the whole field) and anticipating how the play will develop.\nWhen your man cuts deep, I will tell you if the throw is coming up or not.\nWhen your man begins setting up his cut, I will tell you how to adjust your position to shut him down (\u0026ldquo;get closer/tighter,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;stay under,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;go with,\u0026rdquo; etc.)\nIf you are guarding the dump, I will let you know when he becomes a threat (\u0026ldquo;he’s looking,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Colin, it’s you!\u0026rdquo; etc.)\nIf you are marking, I will tell you what’s a threat (\u0026ldquo;inside/around/dump/swing\u0026rdquo;)\nIf your positioning is perfect, then I will let you know, \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;that’s good.\u0026rdquo;\nSecond, I try to convey information in a way that is specific, but concise. A little extra information can go a long way. For example, while \u0026ldquo;UP!\u0026rdquo; is a common call, adding one word onto that makes the call significantly more helpful, yet still quick to say, e.g., \u0026ldquo;Up – short/low/left/right/break/fast/floaty/hammer!\u0026rdquo; Similarly, \u0026ldquo;No Break\u0026rdquo; is less helpful than a more specific cue like \u0026ldquo;No swing.\u0026rdquo;\nFinally, I have three rules to help make my contribution 100% positive:\nI never yell calls by name. \u0026ldquo;He’s dragging!\u0026rdquo; is ok to yell, while \u0026ldquo;Travel!\u0026rdquo; is not.\nI almost never yell \u0026ldquo;strike.\u0026rdquo; I leave that to the dump defender, who generally knows if he’s in trouble. Also, as a thrower, hearing \u0026ldquo;strike\u0026rdquo; is my cue to throw a gigantic break.\nI try to look forward to help stay positive. Obviously, \u0026ldquo;No Continue\u0026rdquo; is a much more helpful thing to yell than \u0026ldquo;No more breaks!\u0026rdquo;\n"

  "issue": "030",
  "content": "Most offenders will tell you that yelling instructions to them on the sideline when they\u0026rsquo;re on offense is annoying, if not worse. When you\u0026rsquo;re on offense, sideline chatter is best saved for positive encouragement and celebrating a goal scored.\nHowever, on D, the sideline is an incredibly powerful tool, able to create momentum on your side, stop momentum for the other team, and create blocks that otherwise wouldn\u0026rsquo;t happen.\nNow, a good sideline voice has a few characteristics.\nFirst, the voice has to be heard. Duh, right? But if you\u0026rsquo;ve got five teammates on the sidelines all yelling at you on the mark, you hear them all and none of them at the same time, and any usefulness is lost. Having individual players talking and listening is crucial.\nSecond, the talk itself must be clear and concise. One syllable is best\u0026ndash; \u0026ldquo;Up!\u0026rdquo; is quick and immediately recognizable. \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;Heytakeawaythebreakside!\u0026rdquo; is not.\nFinally, you must create a team language and practice it. If you say \u0026ldquo;Looking break!\u0026rdquo; to a mark, do you mean an inside-out or an around break throw? Which should he take away? You must decide upon, teach, and then practice sideline voice for it to be effective, but if you do, it can do wonders for a defense.\nNext, what situations are best aided by help from the sidelines?\nThe major help comes when your field of vision is limited, and the sideline can inform you of what is happening in areas you can\u0026rsquo;t see.\nThe mark is the easiest example. You are facing the thrower, and cannot see what he is looking at. The sideline can tell you what his options are, or instruct you what to take away, ie \u0026ldquo;No inside! No around! No huck!\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;ve toyed with the idea of practicing an active sideline voice helping the mark to the point that there is no force, simply a sideline instructing the mark what to take away and making every throw a \u0026ldquo;break\u0026rdquo; throw. Certainly not a go-to D, but maybe a good stunt to mix things up and create some chaos.\nDownfield defenders\u0026rsquo; field of vision can also be limited in a hard man defense. Often if a cutter is being face-guarded (defender staring only at cutter, never checking to see where the disc is), a savvy cutter can move this defender into a place far out of position once the disc has moved, and create an easy opportunity to get open. While the defender should check to see the disc\u0026rsquo;s position, this is an opportunity for sideline voice to be incredibly effective, informing him when, and where, the disc has moved and letting him reposition without taking his eyes off the cutter. Of course, this information must still meet the criteria above (heard, clear, concise, and practiced), but it can be done.\nOne caveat\u0026ndash; don\u0026rsquo;t tell the defender where to go, tell him what to know. Yelling \u0026ldquo;move left\u0026rdquo; is nearly worthless, but yelling \u0026ldquo;not looking\u0026rdquo; as his man cuts deep to tell him that the thrower is staring backwards at the dump and the huck is not a threat is very useful.\nFinally, how do you encourage sideline involvement?\nAfter creating, teaching, and practicing your sideline voice, you still gotta have guys do it, and after your offense grinds out a long grueling point with multiple turnovers and are absolutely gassed and your motivation is lacking because you\u0026rsquo;re down 3, how do you bolster the energy?\nFirst and foremost, the effect of sidelines needs to be made clear and important by the captains. A good captain knows how strong a vocal sideline voice can be, and by encouraging it positively (it will helps us) rather than negatively (come on guys what the hell we need to be louder!) you will see the best results.\nSecond, good sub-calling that involves the whole or most of the team early on goes a long way in engaging the entire team. If a guy hasn\u0026rsquo;t played in the game, it\u0026rsquo;s tough for him to engage as much as he could. If he is subbed in early on, not only does he know he\u0026rsquo;s getting crucial PT, but he is excited for the rest of the game on the sideline.\nTo conclude:\nA strong sideline voice can be the difference between a near-block and a block. It must be heard, concise, and understood quickly through practice. There are many defensive opportunities for sideline voice to help, often by seeing what the on-field defender can\u0026rsquo;t, and communicating only the most useful information. Remember, don\u0026rsquo;t tell him where to go, tell him what to know. Finally, instill an appreciation for the importance of sideline voice early and often, and involve people early in games to help create energy from everyone.\n"

  "content": "The impact of the sideline is most important when the team is on defense. In ultimate, as in most possession style games, the offense has a distinct advantage. The offense is in control of where the future will take place on the field and therefore offensive players are ABLE to be a step ahead of the defense at all times. It is the job of the defenders to constantly anticipate where the thrower would like to throw and when those spaces will be available, while at the same time making decisions to force blocks. The defender has a lot of responsibility. So how can you help this multitasker out?\nTell your defender things that they can’t see.\nTell the marker if the cutter is coming force or break side. Tell the mark when they should strike*. Tell the mark to deny a certain throw if a cutter is wide open. Look at the field and tell the mark about cuts that are coming from far away. Tell everybody the disc is up. Tell the defender chasing a deep cutter that the throw is not coming or that the disc was just swung to the break side. Tell that same defender that he \u0026ldquo;is up\u0026rdquo; when the next pass is logically coming to his guy. Tell a defender in the back of the stack, or deepest, to \u0026ldquo;poach off\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;look to help\u0026rdquo; if one of your teammates is getting beat deep. Tell a crafty defender to \u0026ldquo;poach off\u0026rdquo; when he is chasing deep but will run right by the next for sure in cut.\nMuch of this takes practice on both ends. The voice needs to practice efficiently getting your point across, anticipating the next logical offensive move, and knowing who on the field is willing and ready to listen and quickly react to their information. (Not sure how to assist the hearing impaired) And practice this at practice because it is a skill to speak and to listen. Both necessitate reactive timing only achieved through repetition.\nI personally play better when I know my teammates got my back, are watching me, and are using their precious energy reserves to help me help the team. It’s a powerful thing.\n*Strike- A code word often used to inform the marker that the next open side throwing motion of the thrower will be for real and BITE heavy for the handblock.\n"

  "content": "Like any team, Death or Glory had its own mythology. As a green twenty-year old, very few tales of the past loomed as large for me as Paul Greff’s block against the Condors in 1998. It seemed told and told again: as the deep in the zone at a critical point, Paul hears someone on the sideline telling him to drop and he does, without looking, just in time to get a game saving block. The message was clear - sideline voice won DoG a national championship - and I was hooked.\nEffective communication from the players on the sideline can be a crucial advantage for a team. Sideline communication can improve your team’s level of play by allowing defenders to respond to more than they can see. The sidelines can remind players of strategic goals that get lost in the shuffle and can bring a team together in a new way. I think sideline voice is something I’m very good at. It’s something I’m as proud of, and work as much at, as any more visible part of my game.\nHowever, I think it’s very hard to do effectively. Playing Ultimate is physically demanding, and having a second job to do when you come off the field is often overwhelming. Most teams are unsuccessful when it comes to sideline communication – you’re reading this, aren’t you? Becoming successful requires a shift in team mentality, hard work, and practice time just like any team concept.\nI would argue that the majority of team’s difficulties comes from players not knowing what to say, or not being compelled to put in the work. On DoG, participation from the sideline was a given. It was woven into what it meant to be on the team. On Sockeye, we spend practice time talking about our goals and strategy for communication. I know that the prompt for this article has to do with how I talk on the sideline, and I’ll get to that. But I think it’s most important to focus on how to lay a team-wide foundation.\nWe’ve changed things over the years on Sockeye, but have recently found that it’s effective for each player on the sideline to have just one or two people that they are always responsible for. When Skip or Reid are on the field, I know that I need to talk to them, and they can expect to hear my voice. Everyone has a small group like this. This is a little less daunting, I think, than the amorphous sense that I should be talking to ‘someone’, and allows me to learn what sorts of things these two players need to hear and how to best communicate with them.\nOnce we have our posse, each year we spend about fifteen minutes talking about the \u0026ldquo;why and how\u0026rdquo; of our sideline communication. By talking about why we do this, why it’s important, we are helping everyone to buy in – nobody likes working hard on the mark, but we do it because we all understand why it’s important. The difference with sideline voice is that it’s not as visibly clear why you need it…but you do.\nI mentioned before that not knowing what to say can be the biggest impediment to talking from the sideline, and so we work hard to define as a team what sorts of things need to be relayed from the sideline and how to do so. We keep our vocabulary simple – ‘in’, ‘out’, ‘left’, ‘right’, ‘no break’, etc. – in the hopes that it becomes easy for everyone to open their mouth and easy to respond to what is heard. The goal here is to take the thinking out of yelling and listening.\nFrom there, we walk through what each point will look like from the sideline’s perspective. The vast majority of our sideline talk happens when we’re on defense, either pulling or after an offensive turnover. We expect everyone to know the defense we’re playing. We use a simple code for relaying this information, believing that it’s more important for us to know the defense than it is for us to hide it from the other team. In practice we emphasize the importance of everyone understanding each defense as we work on it, even players who will never play it. I can’t remember the last time I was on the field for a zone defense, but by understanding the role of a wing in our 4-man cup, I can help communicate in the way that he needs.\nFrom there it’s up to me, as an individual, to follow through. Before the point starts, I make an effort to verbally connect with the person I’m talking to (\u0026ldquo;Skip, I’m your voice\u0026rdquo;). Much of my success on the sideline depends on being heard amidst the other yelling, and I want him to hear my voice and know that that’s what to listen for. Throughout the point, I try to make sure that he won’t lose that thread, and that means continually saying something – \u0026ldquo;Skip in, Skip in, Skip you’re fine, Skip you’re good, Skip left, Skip left, Skip mark, Skip mark!\u0026rdquo; – while staying as close to him as I can. It means following him up and down the field on the sideline, and means resisting the urge to watch the play to see what happens.\nIf this sounds like hard work, it is. It takes practice, just like anything else. Just like the timing of my cutting, I find that I feel bad about my sideline voice until around Regionals where I start to really hit my stride – but it’s worth it. When Skip or Reid get a block, I crow to my teammates \u0026ldquo;That’s my block!\u0026rdquo;. False puffery, sure, but it’s also a reflection of the fact that I do believe that I contribute to their successes (and they tell me as much), and it feels great in the moments that the work pays off. It’s worth it.\nOne last thought: we’ve all felt the ebb and flow of a game, and we talk on Sockeye as one way of having some control over the game’s momentum. Staying active from the sideline can feel easy when your team is cruising, but maintaining that same energy when you’re down a few breaks is when it really matters most. Turning the tide doesn’t just happen, and I think rising to meet that challenge from the sideline is one of the things that most teams ignore.\nI encourage you to treat the development of a culture of sideline voice just as you would any other part of your team. Set team expectations for sideline voice just like you do for practice attendance and hold your teammates accountable in the same way. Practice your sideline strategy and implementation. Set goals for tournaments and revisit those goals after each game. Try talking from the sideline (and responding to what you hear, which is another skill unto itself) at practice just as you hope to in a game.\nThese aren’t revolutionary suggestions for any on-field skill, and I think they pay dividends just as much for sideline communication. Being good at this as a team WILL help you win games, and it WILL make the experience more fun. It’s not easy, but when you have twenty teammates yelling and high-fiving on the sideline of a sweltering tournament game while your opponents cringe in the shade tent, when you come home from tournaments hoarse and happy, when you respond to a voice to get the block that wins a national championship, you’ll see that it feels worth it.\n"

  "content": "Assuming there are other essays that discuss the importance of having one sideline voice using simple language, I\u0026rsquo;ll take a slightly contrarian approach to the topic: there\u0026rsquo;s not much you can really accomplish from the sideline during a game. Put more accurately, the best you can hope for from your sideline is to help remind the players on the field of what they already know. Defensive blocks are created by players executing the strategy they decided on before the point. Sideline information rarely generates a block and, much more often than not, can actually serve to undermine the preexisting strategy. There is little hope that someone on the sideline can \u0026ldquo;joystick\u0026rdquo; a player on the field into a block; but he/she can certainly joystick a teammate out of position.\nTake, for example, the mark, which is where communication from off the field is standard. As far as I could tell, 2010 was the year of the rotated mark. On Team USA we employed it all the time, shifting the sideline trap mark at stall 5 or so to take away the dump, then having the dump defender play the upline cut. On PoNY we saw this defense all season, and really only figured out how to beat it on Sunday at Regionals. It\u0026rsquo;s a very effective strategy when everyone\u0026rsquo;s on the same page.\nAnd when was it less effective? More often than not, when the mark would jump back out of position because someone on the sideline was giving them too much information.\nSo, what did successful sideline communication look like in this case?\nStall 1-5: \u0026ldquo;No break\u0026hellip;No inside\u0026hellip;No around\u0026rdquo;\nStall 5: \u0026ldquo;Rotate!\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;90!\u0026rdquo; or whatever term you have for the mark taking away the dump\nStall 6-10: (Calmly) \u0026ldquo;Hold it\u0026hellip;steady\u0026hellip;take a step back\u0026hellip;no foul\u0026rdquo;\nThe unsuccessful version?\nStall 1-5: \u0026ldquo;No break\u0026hellip;No inside\u0026hellip;No around\u0026rdquo;\nStall 5: \u0026ldquo;Rotate!\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;90!\u0026rdquo; or whatever term you have for the mark taking away the dump\nStall 6-10: (Frantic) \u0026ldquo;NO LINE!!! NO INSIDE!!! EVERYONE FREAK OUT!!!!\u0026rdquo;\nIf the sideline starts to flood the player on the field with too much information, and information that\u0026rsquo;s out of sync with the overall strategy, the mark gets jumpy, gives us a cheap foul, and all of a sudden the thrower or the cutter can find a bail-out for him or herself at the last second.\nThe point is, trust your preexisting game plan, the one you developed when everyone was calmer and more reasoned. Don\u0026rsquo;t expect a player to be able to process your information, stray from the strategy, and make a play all in real-time. If the wing in the zone\u0026rsquo;s number one priority is to take away the line as it swings, just make sure that you\u0026rsquo;re reminding them to do so. If you\u0026rsquo;ve decided to front a particular player on the other team, spend the point telling his defender \u0026ldquo;front\u0026hellip;front\u0026hellip;front\u0026rdquo;. Keep it simple, and keep it consistent. It may not be the most enticing way to communicate from the sideline, but it\u0026rsquo;ll pay dividends over the course of a long game.\n"

  "content": "I think that sideline contributions are underrated in their worth by most teams and particularly by most great players. People who are great at team sports are not necessarily motivated to play well for themselves – especially in our sport, they are motivated to play well by their love of team, teammates and something bigger than themselves.\nIn this way, I will stand by something I accidentally said in a huddle last year: \u0026ldquo;Loud information is good information.\u0026rdquo; Now, of course this is a generalization, but particularly when you are teaching people who are shy or new to sideline talk what to do, first things first you must be loud! You must make an impact on your teammate’s game and if you are speaking quietly, your impact will be lost. No matter what you say, make it loud – cup your hands around your mouth, deepen your voice and yell.\nAs someone who is mostly involved with women’s and youth ultimate, I can say that from the sideline, you should be darn close to 100% positive and informational. Especially on offense, cheering is the best way to help – it is difficult to react to direction from the sideline when you are doing your best to read the defense, thrower, and other cutters. On defense, \u0026ldquo;up\u0026rdquo; calls and talking to the mark are the most important but still you must be LOUD! Negativity will motivate only about 1% of the ultimate players out there so unless you know your player very well, stick to the positive and maybe provide constructive observations after the point.\nEffective sideline talk is a part of every great team’s success. If you talk well from the sideline you will feel more bought in, you will be engaged in every point (no loss of focus), and you will make a bigger positive impact on every game. Just a taste of what it’s like trying to be a good coach.\n"

  "title": "Make It Useful",
  "author": "Jim Parinella",
  "issue": "030",
  "content": "Basic principles of sideline talk are fairly simple: make it targeted (say the player’s name first), make it specific (not just \u0026ldquo;c’mon, go, go\u0026rdquo;), and give information (not instruction). You may not know what the player already knows and is planning, so this lets him decide what to do and how to handle the info. (Sometimes, if the level of trust is high, off-field players can give instructions rather than information.)\nOn each point, especially in zone D, establish a one-to-one relationship, so Tom and only Tom is talking to Joe (although occasionally Joe needs to hear from Fred on the other side of the field). On some occasions, a simple exhortation to try harder can be good enough, but don’t forget to throw an occasional compliment for a good defensive effort that results in nothing more than taking away an option.\nOn offense, less is generally more. Telling a receiver \u0026ldquo;No one\u0026rdquo; (is making an effort to block the pass) or (beware of the) \u0026ldquo;man on\u0026rdquo; is about the only thing I like to hear on the field from the sideline. Please don’t call my name unless I really need to know something immediately. Another possibility is to stand behind the thrower in a trap situation to give the thrower an extra second sometimes to find the open guy.\nBy now, though, I think the above might qualify as conventional wisdom, and there are some dominant personalities on each team that are going to control the sideline talk. As a quiet guy (despite the volumes of writing), I find that there are things that I can do, that the majority do not, that fit my style and can help the team.\nWhen we’re on defense, I will position myself farther downfield than any of the players. This way, I can see the hucks coming even before they are thrown, and yell at the defender to get him on his horse to catch up and then direct him once the pass is up (and even to be in position in an unobserved game to call in/out or offer advice on a foul call). One downside is that this isolates you from the rest of the team, but take heart in knowing that you can add a turnover or two per tournament.\n"

  "content": "Sideline talk should make the players on the field more effective in two ways: it should help them make different decisions than they might make otherwise, and it should help them (re)act more quickly to game situations. In other words, the primary functions of sideline talk are to provide new information, and to provide reinforcement that cuts down processing time.\n\u0026lsquo;Provide new information\u0026rsquo;: tell the player on the field anything they can\u0026rsquo;t see that might- or should- change the way they play for the next few seconds or passes. Generally, this type of sideline call will mostly come on the defensive end, when your players are primarily focused on their assignment. The \u0026lsquo;UP!\u0026rsquo; call is perhaps the most basic of these, and the absence of this call as a team habit is a hallmark of inexperience. Does your team use any of these calls from the sideline: \u0026ldquo;Broken!\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ve got time!\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Who\u0026rsquo;s poached?!\u0026rdquo; ?\n\u0026lsquo;Reinforcement\u0026rsquo;: In my experience, it\u0026rsquo;s more difficult to provide helpful sideline talk to the players on offense. Most of the time, cutters know their job and cutting can be incredibly subjective, down to abstractions such as the number of steps you need to make your move, or the feeling of how close on you your defender is. Reinforcing talk that helps make decisions faster can cut down on offensive miscues and the awkward waffling that often happens at the transition between cutting and clearing. \u0026ldquo;Clear out\u0026rdquo; calls can help a cutter instinctively peel out of a lane instead of taking an extra three steps wondering if the disc will come. \u0026ldquo;Look dump\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;swing it!\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;move the ball!\u0026rdquo; et cetera can remind a handler of his obligations. Overdone, these can quickly become overkill, but used judiciously these reinforcing calls can facilitate your cutting system and keep the disc moving.\nOn defense, reinforcing calls will largely bolster the willpower of the defensive player, and thus production. The player knows very well that he should play the open side of his man, but often he is tired, sore and unfocused. Staying in his ear when he\u0026rsquo;s out of position will remind him that his job is important and appreciated and often provide the needed energy to finish out the point.\nThe most effective sidelines will specialize sideline players. Instead of just watching the game and calling out things that you notice happening, assign sideline players to different onfield players or to different roles. Here are two sideline roles that I take most frequently:\n*Talk to Deep\u0026ndash; Have someone always talking to the deepest player; in addition to making sure no one sneaks out on him, you can also keep an eye on whether the thrower is taking notice of a deep cut. If I always know who\u0026rsquo;s deepest at a given moment, or which tall fast guy can lend support, I can scream his name out the instant I see a big thrower start his windup or get the disc upline. The second that will give before everyone else yells \u0026lsquo;UP!\u0026rsquo; can often mean two steps, a full commitment, and the D.\n*Behind the Marker\u0026ndash; My favorite sideline role is to take a position directly behind the thrower when the disc is coming in on my sideline. Talking to the mark, I can see everything the thrower can see. Its generally obvious from that position who the cutting options are and when the thrower\u0026rsquo;s faking, and I can help the mark only shift the force in reaction to real threats. I use the calls \u0026rsquo;left hand\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;right hand\u0026rsquo; to cut down processing time, as opposed to \u0026rsquo;no I/O\u0026rsquo; etc. A good pair of marker and caller can often take risks\u0026ndash; such as jumping the dump look on a higher count\u0026ndash; that would be foolish without a caller confirming that no one dropped an assignment on an open side cutter.\nDoes your team emphasize sideline talk? Do you acknowledge this each point? How much of your talk provides information or confirmation?\n"

  "issue": "030",
  "content": "Standing on the sidelines is, for many players, the hardest or most frustrating part of being on a team. Ultimate is special in the larger world of sports in that the sideline is a great place to help your team out. Where in other sports the sideline is not allowed to actively participate by communicating with their fellow players on the field, in Ultimate the sideline can work as an eighth player, one with position and focus dedicated to improving the outcome of strategies and plays being made my fielded players. Yet, being a sideline voice isn\u0026rsquo;t a simple thing to master.\nA good rule of thumb to start with is to keep your help simple. Start off with clear and attentive \u0026ldquo;Up\u0026rdquo; calls and keep your teammates motivated on the field when they are tired. If possible, find positions with good perspectives on plays to help with in/out and up/down calls.\nThe next step for me is pairing-off a sideline player with an on-field player. Pairing up is something that takes work and requires trust between players, but gives an added edge if done properly. It’s much easier for any player if they are allowed to focus on guarding or marking on defense, and having an extra pair of eyes to help reposition one\u0026rsquo;s defense only adds to that. A clear example is when maintaining a mark, your buddy on the sideline who can see the field and immediate threats behind you can help you reposition to take away a pass to an oncoming threat. Calls to \u0026ldquo;strike\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;no break\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;no huck\u0026rdquo; can build up your defense immensely. These players also help keep their partners balanced as well as focused on the team\u0026rsquo;s own strategy by calling out reminders.\nThe key to getting this right is to know the player you are assisting and have his trust. If you make a call that ends up going badly, it’s rough. So keep calls to what\u0026rsquo;s simple, what you know, and to what you\u0026rsquo;ve practiced. Keep your teammates pumped; motivate them whenever you are not instructing.\nAn added benefit of sideline pairings, especially on less developed teams with players at different levels of gameplay, is that it creates an organized way to help each other. Avoid cross-shouting instructions from different players on the sideline. If you have one voice to lock on to, then no one gets confused.\nDeveloping trust between players is key for this partnering to work, so know the player with whom you are working. Newer players to the team deserve some attention, but players with tough jobs during a point take precedence. Take time to develop the use of the sideline during practices.\n"

  "content": "Different teams have a very different approach to the role of individuals when they’re on the sideline. Some teams like to give the players on the sideline a chance to rest and have them sit in the shade to recover for their next time in the game. Others, especially in the college ranks, can have countless players making tons of useless noise from the sidelines. I think the best teams find a way to keep players involved in the success of the team when they are not one of the seven guys on the field. There are countless ways to do this.\nOffensively, teams usually have a set of phrases that may define their offensive objective. Things like \u0026ldquo;swing\u0026rdquo; (the disc), \u0026ldquo;keep cutting\u0026rdquo; or (move the disc to the) \u0026ldquo;middle\u0026rdquo; are keywords that remind players to look for specific throws or cuts within the context of the offense. These cues can serve as helpful ways to influence the play on the field, while not over- coaching or distracting the players from doing their things. In zone offense, there is a possibility for even more talk from the sideline to help position players or point out something that a thrower might be missing. However, I’ve generally thought that offenses are better left to work without the distraction of a lot of sideline input.\nDefensively there is a much greater opportunity for the sidelines to contribute to the onfield performance. The most basic is to give players \u0026ldquo;up\u0026rdquo; calls when the disc is in the air. Putting a name on the end of that up call, is the next step for helping the individual who the disc is going to. The next step is for the sideline to be aware of the defense for that point, as well as the general defensive philosophy. Does the dump defender overplay the backwards pass, or protect against the dump going upfield? Is the marker pressuring a backwards pass, possibly at the cost of giving up an inside-out break throw? If the sideline knows the defensive priorities they can instruct both the dump and the marker about a subtle shift in positioning to work within the defensive concept. Telling the marker where that dump cutter is with predetermined words (\u0026ldquo;left\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;45\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;flat\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;strike\u0026rdquo;) can make the marker much more effective with simple phrases.\nIn the zone there is an even greater chance for the sideline to help. Because of the nature of zone defense, it is possible for a sideline player to talk to a single onfield player for the entire point. Effective sideline communicators will keep a continuous stream of talk to help the player stay with that voice. I’ve also found that a name, followed by an instruction is a much better way to communicate than just yelling instructions. For example, \u0026ldquo;Greg drop, Greg right, Greg you’re good\u0026rdquo; tells Greg to drop, move right, and then stay where he is. There are a number of phrases that can speak to specific actions, but each team may have different terms for those. However, the continuous flow of information from the sidelines to the field will help players be their most responsive to sideline communication.\nFinally, sidelines can do a lot to pump up players on the field, or similarly, contribute to the mood of an ugly game. Condors had a simple rule that you don’t talk to the other team’s onfield players from the sideline. If an opponent made a bad call, telling your teammate that he made a great play gets the same message across as telling the opponent he is a cheater. However, by doing the former you are pumping up your team while possibly creating doubt in the opponent, while the latter overlooks your teammate’s play and may inspire the opponent. Sidelines can also do well in creating an intimidating presence with strong communication and forceful encouragement. Just the act of knowing that a teammate is watching me is usually enough to make me give maximum effort and do my best. With seven onfield players channeling that energy, a team can be lifted to a higher level of play.\n"

  "content": "As cliché as it may be, it is true that the sideline can equate to the eighth man (woman) for a team. However, I would say the sideline can mean much more than just an eighth man. The sideline can be a symbolic representation of the morale and demeanor of the game.\nMost speak of the sideline and the tangible benefits of using your voices to motivate and push your teammates in the heat of battle on the field. Everyone that has run track or cross country, or even a conditioning practice with your team, knows how much harder you work when you are being encouraged by your brethren. The benefit of taking your mind off the pain, struggle, and fatigue you are facing and being granted a mental distraction to refocus all of that defeat into a positive- that you are doing it for your teammates. This has immediate benefits and is the very least a sideline can do to influence the success of their team without stepping on the field.\nThe next most advantageous aspect is still more constructive. Unlike many other sports, we are blessed to be able to give active coaching throughout the entire point of play. We are not limited to coaching areas during the point as in basketball, punished for helping as in golf, or limited by time as in football. We are able to have players along the whole perimeter giving advice to players throughout the entire point. I find the best way to optimize this benefit is to allocate one sideline player to each on-field player so they have one voice to listen for. This is especially important in zone as a player can often get contradictory, or at least conflicting, advice during a point. Next, it isn’t about giving them trivial advice, information they already know, such as the force or who they are marking, but about invaluable info they are not able to obtain. For instance, on the mark, if they are correctly forcing forehand but the only real threat is a backhand, informing them to switch the mark for 1-2 seconds to the ‘technically’ wrong force. Because you are able to see the entire field much like the thrower, you are aware of the likely option the thrower wants to take and can inform your mark of this information to give them a level playing field. The ability to have a knowledgeable enough sideline to do this is usually worth a few Ds a game.\nHowever, though the previous was tangibly effective, the most advantageous aspect of the sideline is attitude. Although it is the least tangible, the best thing a sideline can do is be positive, optimistic and supportive of their players and each other. Most good teams are waiting for the opportunity to step on the opposition’s throat, which is keyed in on when they seem down and discouraged. If you never give them this opportunity, not only do you keep your team’s environment a positive and unified one, you can potentially leach the opposition’s confidence, giving your team an edge late in the game when it matters. A good example of this is Seattle’s Sockeye. They keep their mental state on the sideline positive and encouraging, keeping their players focused on the points ahead instead of mistakes that might have occurred that could lead to future mistakes.\n"

  "content": "In the moment of competition, I like my brain to be functioning on approximately the level of a caveman chasing a woolly mammoth. The biggest motivation to help from the sideline is that the louder I yell, the more primordial I feel, and the better I play. It’s the best way for me to get in and stay in \u0026ldquo;the zone.\u0026rdquo;\nHere is a great description of the zone, which I recently read in a novel:\n\u0026ldquo;She felt a special private connection with the basket, always knowing exactly where it was and always trusting that she was its favorite player on the floor, the best at feeding its circular mouth. Even off the court she existed in the zone, which felt like a kind of preoccupied pressure behind her eyebrows, an alert drowsiness or focused dumbness that persisted no matter what she was doing.\u0026rdquo;\nThis \u0026ldquo;focused dumbness\u0026rdquo; is the goal of my training. My hours spent throwing, running drills, and scrimmaging are all designed to teach my brain and muscles to respond instantly without thought. When I’m competing, my conscious mind can only get in the way and slow me down. This is what we mean when we tell our teammates, \u0026ldquo;Get out of your head,\u0026rdquo; or, \u0026ldquo;Get into the game\u0026rdquo;: Stop thinking; just do it.\nThe most vulnerable time for players, psychologically speaking, is when we’re not playing. That’s when we have time to think. Joe Montana said, \u0026ldquo;As soon as you know you’re in the zone, you’re not in the zone.\u0026rdquo; Why is that? Because the part of your brain that can make that kind of realization is not the caveman part of your brain. (Sure, it’s possible to be both a great player and a great thinker – but not simultaneously.)\nMy goal on the sideline is to leave no room for reflective thought by focusing totally on the game. I talk with teammates about what they’ve been doing well or what we’re going to do next point to respond to our opponent’s tactics. I yell team cheers. I pick a teammate on the line and shout specific information throughout the point. (\u0026ldquo;Big thrower\u0026rdquo;; \u0026ldquo;not a thrower\u0026rdquo;; \u0026ldquo;disc is swinging\u0026rdquo;; \u0026ldquo;no huck\u0026rdquo;; \u0026ldquo;all underneath\u0026rdquo;; \u0026ldquo;left hand low\u0026rdquo;; \u0026ldquo;last back\u0026rdquo;; etc.) Halfway through the point, I usually get distracted by another teammate who needs a good bout of yelling and I get in his ear.\nI yell the most specific and concrete information possible. General encouragement is great (\u0026ldquo;keep working hard\u0026rdquo;), but my teammate is less likely to have his mark broken if I’m yelling \u0026ldquo;stay on your toes\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;rotate no around\u0026rdquo;. Also, the more specific the information I yell, the more focused I have to be on the game.\nI try to yell only positive things. Any time I say something negative, even under my breath, I allow the thought to enter my mind that \u0026ldquo;things aren’t going well.\u0026rdquo; It’s not long before that thought ruins the useful illusion – which is a big part of \u0026ldquo;the zone\u0026rdquo; – that my team and I are unstoppable.\nIf I’m successful on the sidelines, when I step back on the line to play, it feels like I never left the game. In other words, I’m still \u0026ldquo;in my rhythm.\u0026rdquo; I’m sure the sideline talk has also helped my teammates but the biggest benefit is my own. I get another shot at playing in the zone.\n"

  "issue": "030",
  "content": "When you find yourself on the sideline, there are two obvious things to do during a point. You should serve as an extra brain and pair of eyes to help them execute the team’s strategy, and you need to encourage them to keep putting in effort. I’ll skip over these two aspects of sideline help (which I hope others will cover in more detail), and focus on one aspect which takes place after a point is over, and one aspect which is believed to be helpful, but is frequently not, and should be discouraged.\nA mistake/learning opportunity during the middle of a point is hard for a player on the field to capitalize on their own because they were thinking about the 50 other things which happened during that point. However, a teammate on the sideline is in a much better situation to recognize, remember, offer perspective, and therefore help teammates improve. If you have trouble remembering, write it down. If you’re not sure how a mistake might be corrected, or if a mistake was made at all, talk to a more experienced teammate. In my opinion it is better to watch one person the entire point, as opposed to many people. Not only can you help that person in real-time, but you can also get a feel for what that person was trying to do, instead of taking one mistake out of context.\nFinally, just because the point is over doesn’t mean you need to stop encouraging the teammate you’ve been watching. If you didn’t notice any mistakes, praise their effort. In fact, even if you did notice something they could improve upon, that doesn’t mean you should ignore the rest of the point where they were playing well. Give praise where praise is due.\nThe one thing I’ve never been a fan of is a sideline voice that tells me to do something which is the right play in a vacuum, but is contradictory to the team’s strategy. Practically speaking, the chain of events which must take place is often way too slow to be helpful. A person on the sideline needs to recognize what’s going to happen, figure out the appropriate response, communicate it to someone on the field, who then needs to recognize and react in a way they weren’t anticipating. Furthermore, the principle of playing on a team and having a cohesive strategy is undermined every time someone freelances, and is made worse when your own teammate is encouraging you to do so.\nEvery time a player does something unexpected, there is almost always a trade- off which weakens the approach a team is taking. A prime example of this is a strike call on a sideline trap. You hear this call quite a bit, but acting on a strike call does two things. First, the marker is giving up the portion of the field the rest of the team is expecting them to take away. Second, it helps out a defender who was beat to a position of the field that was their responsibility to take away, not the marker’s. So, not only is the marker rewarding that one defender who was beat by trying to cover for their mistake, but by changing the mark they are screwing the other five defenders by letting off an easy break mark throw. This isn’t to say strike calls are bad. But your team needs to decide that occasionally stopping that throw is worth the mark abandoning the portion of the field for which they are responsible.\n"

Every team has players who see plays happen/develop (be it from on the pitch or the sideline), and compile the information to start the next point with the knowledge they just took on board (and, importantly, can dispense it to their teammates). It is these adaptive players that win tight matches.\nThe natural ability to analyze mid-experience is difficult to develop but not impossible. Two simple steps are watch as much Ultimate as you can and then help to coach. Moving from playing to coaching forces players to look at the game in a new light; not only do you need to see everything that happens on the pitch, but now you have the chance to do it because you\u0026rsquo;re on the sideline.\nPersonally, I find it very difficult to analyze a game as it develops when I\u0026rsquo;m playing a part in it. My mind needs to focus on the immediate — on the task at hand at that very second. If I want more than that I need to get off the field, watch a little and then figure it out — usually time that I do not have. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t until I started coaching that I began to realize how much I had been missing.\n"

  "content": "Good field vision can be described as a contrast between being somebody with good field sense and somebody who has \u0026ldquo;visionary throws.\u0026rdquo; If you have ever been called \u0026ldquo;visionary\u0026rdquo; I bet that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t a compliment.\nMost of the time people who are described as having good field vision are players who have a general sense of what is going on with all 14 players on the field. This is broken down into four things: a good understanding of passing lanes, a strong mastery of various throwing skills, a knowledge of what the offensive system is trying to attack and what the defense is currently doing to stop that attack. Anybody who has a visionary throw has gotten away with a dumb decision because of a terrific throw and probably bad defense, i.e. it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have worked but it did. A player with good field vision can close his or her eyes and describe how all 13 other players are positioned and where they intend to go.\nWhen an O point starts there is usually a string called and somebody with good field vision is going to be able to quickly assess whether the called play is on or off based on how hard people are running down and what lanes they are in. This is true for both the thrower and the cutters. As a cutter you should be identifying who is covering you and who is poaching the lanes so that you can set up a good cut if you are in the string or figure out how to engage your player if you are not. When you are a thrower it is more important to be aware of all 7 defenders so that you can make the right throw. This is true in all non-string situations as well and you should be aware of the surroundings at all times.\nAs a thrower there are 3 types of thinkers:\nNew players can focus on the their immediate target and assess whether that player is open or not. This is a binary decision of whether to throw or not to throw. Ideally, the player will be able to see a poach and not make a mistake, but there is little to be gained by merely not throwing to somebody who is double covered. This is the minimal level of success. Moderate players can adjust to a secondary defender and see the poach who is affecting it. If the second player is in their field of vision they should spot that uncovered O player and throw to them since they are uncovered. This is good because it allows the player not to make a mistake and advance the disc, but does not take full advantage of poaches. Great players can see a poach and know what is happening outside of their field of vision. This is where great field vision is most powerful because it allows a player to know where to attack after only looking at half the field. This leads to quick decisions and massive shifts in the focus of the offense, which is devastating to the defense. Joe Montana and LeBron James are cited as having this kind of vision. They know what pass to throw before they look because they see a defender doing something other than guarding the prescribed player. They might not see their teammate, but they can see that they are undefended. In the third scenario the thrower knows what is going to happen one throw ahead of time. In normal offensive flow this means knowing where the next pass is going to go before it\u0026rsquo;s thrown, which will help with spacing and clearing. Also, if the give and go is a part of the offense then a player needs to know when to use it and when it would cut off upfield flow. Ideally a thrower would know where the huck is likely to be generated. Is it going to happen after a swing to the dead side or off an up line dump cut? In both situations it will enable better timing on the part of the cutters and throwers.\nOn occasion it is up to a thrower to create some offense. More often than not this is in a zone where the offensive players are working to create good spacing with various defensive set-ups. The thrower needs to throw to a space where the offensive player can get to the disc well ahead of any defender. In man to man defense, this same theory can apply to stoppages of play, but it is more common in zone where the throw initiates most of the movement. To do this, the thrower needs to assess the defense and, via a fake or other gesture/positioning, cause some defensive movement that will open up the optimal target. When this happens the throw must be to a place where a teammate can get it but no defender can. This requires a strong understanding of what the offense is attacking versus what the defense is taking away. Examples of this are throws through gaps in the cup, short upside down flips over the top or deep hammers to wings.\nI see Ultimate moving toward an NBA/NFL defensive system where the D is trying to make the other team use their secondary option most of the time. This is achieved by taking away certain parts of the field or double teaming a great individual. If we then get into a pattern of O players trying to outthink a D line, with guessing games on both sides, I believe that it will be a major advancement for the sport. Think about Peyton Manning vs. the main linebacker or safety and you will get the picture of where we are going.\nPutting your head down and running hard against your matchup is going to be a less successful strategy in the next 10 years.\n"

  "content": "How do we make decisions? In many real-life examples we create a list of choices and features, maybe take some data, rate how each option stacks up in each feature, and coolly select the optimum choice. In ultimate you don\u0026rsquo;t have the time to go through this whole process. You have to rely on your trained inner self to figure out what to do based on internalized guidelines.\nSince I like lists of rules here are some for making sense of what is happening on the field and figuring out what to do about it:\nTake input from around you. Look, listen, and learn to identify what is important. Communicate — with eye contact, code words, or plain English if you need to.\nUse your experience. A lot of field sense is really just knowing the tendencies of your teammates and opponents. Learn the signs that a defender has committed to a particular move so you can counteract. Become familiar with your offense\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;power positions\u0026rdquo; from which a thrower can deliver an uncontested huck.\nKnow your preferences and strengths (hopefully they are the same). If you\u0026rsquo;re fast enough, all you need is for your defender to lean the wrong way and you can go. Don\u0026rsquo;t bother looking for the forehand huck if you can\u0026rsquo;t hit it reliably.\nKnow your requirements. Be aware of where you are on the field and what your team needs from you at that point. Are others likely to be in good position to provide help or is there just one option?\nHave something to go to if all else fails. We all know to clear if we\u0026rsquo;ve been shut down on a cut, but throwers should know what their final option is too — whether to punt it, look across the field for a long swing, or throw a leading pass to the closest dump. On defense, know what you can concede if you have to and what you absolutely cannot concede.\nAnd here\u0026rsquo;s how you go about getting better at it:\nEngage in deliberate practice. 2 on 2 or 3 on 3 drills that focus on dump passes or first cuts or hucks can get you lots of reps in situations where all the unimportant inputs have been removed.\nCompile an extensive experience bank. Quite frankly, you\u0026rsquo;re going to have to make a lot of mistakes in order to get better. Play, and pay attention. Play summer league or rec tournaments, play goaltimate, play mini. While these can also lead to bad habits, they will give you lots of reps and put you in more situations where you have to make the play or you will lose.\nObtain feedback that is accurate, diagnostic, and timely. In practice ask your opponent why you got beat or why you couldn\u0026rsquo;t get open.\nReview prior experiences. On the sideline between points or between games go over your play in your head. Think about not just your failures and obvious glories, but review the close calls. What could you have done better with that pass so the defender couldn\u0026rsquo;t even have a bid on it? How could you have set up the defender better so that the thrower didn\u0026rsquo;t have to make a perfect pass?\nTo learn, you need to think about what you will be doing and what you just did, so that when it comes time to DO, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to think.\nNote: this article was adapted from the presentation \u0026ldquo;Real Time Decision Making in Ultimate\u0026rdquo; at the Ultimate Players and Coaches Conference in Newton, MA, in Jan 2007\n"

  "content": "Psychologist John Dewey debunked a commonly held belief called the stimulus- response reflex arc: you see something, you decide what to do, you respond. Instead, Dewey proposed, you only see what you have a mental framework for; this framework contains your response within it. In other words, your response exists before you see the stimulus. Many players have the experience of knowing they\u0026rsquo;ve thrown the goal before the disc leaves their hands, or \u0026ldquo;seeing\u0026rdquo; the lay out D before it happens. Great players don\u0026rsquo;t scan the field for openings. That takes too long. Great players recognize the beginning of a pattern that they can complete to their favor. Learning this pattern recognition takes experience, a good system, and focused drilling. No doubt, some players naturally learn quicker than others, and previous sports experience helps. Usually, though, the quick learners are the ones at practice working hard.\nSports Psychologist Alan Goldberg warns against asking players to think on the field. A player should not \u0026ldquo;see\u0026rdquo; the field in that sense. In the huddle don\u0026rsquo;t ask your team to do anything other than rely on its training. Team leaders should examine every drill, even (especially) the mindless warm up patterns. Those drills teach your team the patterns it will later use to read the field. If you want to throw to receivers cutting to space, don\u0026rsquo;t run the \u0026ldquo;straight on attack\u0026rdquo; drill. If you want to throw hucks from the middle of the field, don\u0026rsquo;t run the sideline huck drill. If you want to throw continuation swings after a dump, include that in your reset drill. To better read poaches, try scrimmaging 7(o) on 8(d) with the extra man poaching. Unless you\u0026rsquo;ve drilled it, your players won\u0026rsquo;t see it. And if you\u0026rsquo;ve drilled it wrong, they\u0026rsquo;ll do it wrong. Whatever your team is not \u0026ldquo;seeing\u0026rdquo; tells you, the team leader, where you need to drill differently.\n"

The best athletes don\u0026rsquo;t see what\u0026rsquo;s happening so much as take a picture of the field and respond. A few brains can do that kind of thing, but most can\u0026rsquo;t. Bill Rodriguez would counsel deeps in a zone to move up if they saw seven opposing players in front of them. Super, if, like Bill, you can see them all at once and count them at the same time. But of course something comes with seeing patterns. A player who comes to Ultimate late, after playing years of soccer, will probably have a better feel for the game than a cross- country runner. One of the best first year players I ever saw had been a quarterback. With no one trying to kill him every three seconds, ten seconds seemed like plenty of time to survey and throw.\nThree suggestions to getting better:\n1) Play a different position. Seems obvious, but do it. In that zone or on offense, find a different spot. You will see the game differently and that helps. Famously, Bill Russell ran every Celtics play from every position, not just his own.\n2) Play some scrimmages with different parameters: A shorter or narrower field, a shorter stall, six on seven.\n3) Find a way of trying things you know are never gonna work. \u0026ldquo;After he throws a swing I am going to stand in the lane and watch as I count \u0026ldquo;one, two\u0026rdquo; and look around. Yeah, my guy may go score, but I am seeing what happens. If your team allows for such scrimmages (and for more sensible versions of what I am suggesting) you may be able to develop a better sense of \u0026ldquo;go now\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t wait,\u0026rdquo; which is really all we are talking about.\n"

  "content": "Understanding positioning and distribution of players on the field is an important skill, but also somewhat of an innate ability. How this skill manifests itself is sometimes subtle and other times overt. It can show up in the guy who always seems to be making the good cut to keep the offensive flow going or in the physically ungifted player who consistently finds themselves alone in the endzone. It can be the thrower who is able to find targets on the goal line or the defender who gets a lot of poach blocks. It can be the popper/wing in zone offense who is always touching the disc or the defensive wing whose side the disc never advances on. All these traits come from someone understanding the space around them and where the players on the field are moving.\nI was watching a Division I basketball practice once when a player made a mistake and the coach, rather than ripping into him, asked the player what he saw when he made that decision. By understanding the information that the player was working with, he was better able to instruct the player. This questioning is something that every player should endure, and at least ask themselves, whenever a mistake is made. Did I recognize that poach in the lane? Did I understand the balance of players on the field? Where was the open space for me to cut to? Did I need to protect against my receiver going deep when he was already 50 yards away from the disc? Of course, these questions only deal with the perceived information, rather than what may have actually happened, but it is a good starting place.\nDeveloping field vision, or field sense, is a difficult thing, and requires acute awareness of the other 13 players on the field, even while being involved in the play. One thing that a thrower can do in a practice environment is to throw the disc to the place where he sees the space, even if there is nobody cutting there. By making this throw, it becomes obvious where he is looking, and where he sees the space on the field. Cutters can also draw attention by yelling at the thrower to alert him to where he should be looking. Both these examples deal with one-to-one or one-to-few player interactions. Developing this in a one-to-many or many-to-many fashion is more difficult. There are some drills where a player turns to see a selection of cutters, some which are marked, and others which are unmarked, and has to recognize which players are open. This drill deals more with recognition of cutters, rather than using space, but hopefully through this recognition, a deeper level of identifying open cutters can be achieved. Another situation may be where players close their eyes and then open them as the disc becomes active; they have to quickly get a sense of the balance of players on the field and where they should be moving, recognizing who should be cutting, or what lanes need to be plugged before resuming the offensive/defensive plan.\n"

  "content": "I have a rather painful childhood memory from back in middle school. I was playing basketball and went to set a low screen for another player. In a moment of miscommunication both my defender and the player who I set a pick on rushed to guard my teammate. I was left open for just a few seconds, but before I realized it, the basketball hit me in the face. The point guard recognized that I was about to be open and passed the ball early. I remember appreciating two lessons learned from that moment. First, always keep your head up so you don\u0026rsquo;t get hit in the face unexpectedly. Second, and far more importantly, if you keep your head up you can take advantage of narrow windows of opportunity. This second lesson is field vision.\nLike many Ultimate players, I can trace my field vision skills to non-Ultimate sports like basketball and soccer. These taught me to move without the ball, respond to a teammate\u0026rsquo;s positioning and see open passing lanes. After lots of practice one learns to pick up on tiny cues on the field from which one can anticipate what will happen next. The hours of practice that give a basketball player the field vision to use no-look passes are the same hours of practice that give a handler the field vision to throw to a cutter that isn\u0026rsquo;t open yet. In both cases, field vision is a matter of picking up on and taking advantage of tiny cues. In both cases, the only way to learn those cues is through hours of practice.\nSure, some field vision skills from non-Ultimate sports translate to Ultimate. A brand new Ultimate player with a soccer or lacrosse background will generally have less trouble adjusting to the pace and movement of Ultimate than a brand new player with only a golf background. But just like learning to throw a flick, transferring field vision skills to Ultimate requires practice. I remember my first few weeks playing Ultimate in college when, because of my soccer background, standing in a tight stack in the middle of the field felt so unnatural. I wanted to spread out like in soccer. As a rookie who couldn\u0026rsquo;t throw further than 15 feet, I was pegged as a cutter and continued to struggle with the stack concept until one practice where we were randomly assigned different roles. I got to be a handler, and though I still couldn\u0026rsquo;t throw, I could see where I wanted to throw. That\u0026rsquo;s when the stack concept started to make more sense to me. All it took was seeing the field from a different perspective.\nI think the way to teach field vision, if it can be taught, is to give players the opportunity to see the field from a different perspective, or a different angle, than they are used to. If the player is a cutter, make the player spend some time handling. If the player is a defender, make the player spend some time on the offensive team. If the player is a deep-deep in a zone defense, make the player play in the cup. Seeing the field from different positions helps you hone field vision because you learn the little cues that allow you to anticipate what will happen next. All it takes is practice.\n"

It is not for the champions to tell us how they won; it is our task to try and decipher what made these teams so successful, and how it might be copied or contained at the next tournament. If that is possible, we think it is the players who saw these teams at full strength last fall that likely have the best clues.\nWhat did the champions do very well? Did their team have a particular strength that they rode throughout the tournament?\nDo the champions have any weaknesses, or are we left hoping that they somewhat regress? What might you do differently in 2010 in an attempt to beat them? What should other teams do in order to train for victory over these top teams?\n"

  "content": "Good club teams often have a core of stars who have played with each other for a while. Looking at Chain Lightning\u0026rsquo;s roster last year, I was struck by how little turnover the team experienced. With a few notable exceptions, last year\u0026rsquo;s Chain team was the same team that lost in the semifinals in 2008, bolstered by the addition of five rookies, all of whom Chain used in key defensive roles (e.g. Robert Runner and Patrick Dempsey). Chain\u0026rsquo;s O line, with the exception of Asa, was the same O line that lost in the semifinals in 2006, only with a few more years of experience under its collective belt. And these guys are far from being beyond their athletic prime — the average age of the O-line was 27.\nContrast Chain\u0026rsquo;s roster with that of my team, Ironside. The average \u0026ldquo;tenure\u0026rdquo; of Chain\u0026rsquo;s roster is 4.3 years. That\u0026rsquo;s almost 1.5 more years than Ironside has existed. The average tenure of Chain\u0026rsquo;s O line, where on-field chemistry is arguably much more important than on the D line, is a whopping 6.3 years. On Ironside, that number is 2.0. Even if you look at how long Ironside\u0026rsquo;s O-line has played Open Ultimate in the city of Boston (either for DoG, Metal, or Boss Hogg), the tenure only increases to 3.7.\nWatching Chain play in Sarasota, I saw a team that played with great chemistry. Throwers seemed to know exactly where cutters were going. Cutters saw space and cleared effectively. I didn\u0026rsquo;t see as much trouble resetting the disc with Chain as with other teams. It was clear that the group of players on the field for Chain knew each other and their tendencies well.\n"

  "content": "During DoG\u0026rsquo;s heyday 15 years ago, our main offensive strength was that we would take what they\u0026rsquo;d give us. Our offense was efficient, not just in terms of scoring percentage, but in using energy wisely. Players created space by knowing when to get out of the way or to simply stay put and remain out of the way. We liked the long game, but were equally comfortable in taking a series of passes up the line. We relied on our O players knowing each other, and we\u0026rsquo;d give our receivers options (see above point about getting out of the way) and trust that the throwers could get it there.\nFrom reading the writeups of Chain\u0026rsquo;s O last year and from watching the championship game video, I was dumbstruck by the similarities. Compared to the frenetic movements of Sockeye\u0026rsquo;s receivers, Chain\u0026rsquo;s cutters would often be stationary (though not clogging), and reset cuts were available. They hucked efficiently, but they also would take the reset. Players had specialities, but that wasn\u0026rsquo;t all they did. Their receivers could throw effectively. They broke the mark when they had to and keep the disc moving.\nTo continue winning, Chain needs to keep their O together and to make subtle adjustments based on players\u0026rsquo; changing skills and on defensive adjustments. If they codify the way they are doing things now as \u0026ldquo;the way,\u0026rdquo; teams will adjust and their players will change and they\u0026rsquo;ll spend years trying to recapture the glory.\n"

  "issue": "028",
  "content": "After twelve straight years as a nationals participant in the Open division (1997-2008), in 2009 as a masters player was a different experience. First, few people, and really nobody outside the division itself, care much about the Masters division. That\u0026rsquo;s not to say it isn\u0026rsquo;t competitive, or even that there isn\u0026rsquo;t good Ultimate being played there, it\u0026rsquo;s just that when you have the Open nationals to watch, why would you watch Masters? So even I couldn\u0026rsquo;t focus much on the Masters division, and spent as much time as possible catching the Open games.\nIf there\u0026rsquo;s one thing I\u0026rsquo;ve learned from playing on Sunday in Sarasota (and once in San Diego), it\u0026rsquo;s that few people outside the team can get an accurate read on what is going on inside the team.\nOutsiders to Jam\u0026rsquo;s success would say it was a bunch of veteran players who were able to put it together at the right time. While that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be entirely wrong, I would say there was also a subtle defensive adjustment, a return of our leader and arguably best player who had missed parts of the season (including Regionals), and a new found resolve that hardened the questionably soft Jam.\nThe Condors had great players who had spent years playing together at the top levels, paying their dues, and knew how to rise up when the pressure was toughest. While outsiders saw a great huck game, or individual excellence, the team always believed in a system that put people in a position to do their jobs; a system that was built on at least half a decade of experience and tweaks together.\nAnyhow, one element that can undermine, or enhance, a team\u0026rsquo;s chances in Sarasota is the weather. This year was no different. The heat was the worst I can recall, and I heard that the first day saw the largest single-day consumption of water at nationals. Yes, everyone is playing in the same weather, but the teams that play in that weather consistently have developed strategies to minimize the effects. These teams are most effective at ignoring the impacts that weather has on their body and mind. In addition to the heat and humidity, there was a near-total absence of wind. This certainly helped Chain\u0026rsquo;s successful deep game. While I heard that their underneath game was equally effective, I\u0026rsquo;m sure it would have taken a few turnovers to realize that the wind was affecting their hucks and those few possessions could have changed the complexion of the game.\nFrom what I saw, Chain played an outstanding game with strong offense and hard-nosed defense. This is very similar to the game they\u0026rsquo;ve brought to Florida the last few years when they\u0026rsquo;ve come up a bit short. Were they an improved team this year? I don\u0026rsquo;t doubt it. Did they have a great season, and impressive run at nationals? Absolutely. Did they get an assist from the weather? It\u0026rsquo;s the same answer I would give for my championships\u0026hellip;it didn\u0026rsquo;t hurt. Chain would have had a great chance of winning in any weather, but the weather they got gave them a boost. I\u0026rsquo;m sure the other semifinalists would have preferred cold (Boston), wet (Seattle) or brisk (Revolver) conditions.\n"

  "content": "Despite Backhoe outscoring Brute Squad 9-7 in the second half after starting out the game 0-6, 2-8 at half, Brute never allowed the game to get ugly [ugly meaning a turnover-fest]. Of the 16 goals (37 possessions) scored between the teams in the second half, 12 were scored on one possession: Backhoe was 8 for 9, Brute was 4 for 7; two of the remaining four were 2nd possession goals. Regardless of our unusual second half efficiency (statistically we were strong on O2D and had a high percentage of Offense 2nd possession [O2] goals), we still walked into our match-up with Fury like a wounded animal looking to make too many corrections. And Fury exploited this quickly and easily.\nFury: 15 points on 29 possessions. Their O received the pull 6 times giving up 1 break. 5 goals on 12 possessions. Though they had zero 1 possession goals, 4 of their 5 were 02 goals. The fifth being an O3 and left us giving up two chances to break and narrow the lead to 3-4 instead 2-5, and here they pretty much stepped on our throat, 2-8 at half.\nFury\u0026rsquo;s D scored 10 goals on 17 possessions. 7 of those goals were D1. For the other three, one was D2 for a score of 2-7; and the others were D3. These third possession points were for 12 and 14, so some allowances can be made for their lack of efficiency here — late game sloppiness perhaps. However, 7 of 10 goals were D1 and they absolutely took us out of the game. Coming into the second half, down 2 to 8, we received and scored on our second try, and then earned our only break of the game on the next point for 4-8. We got the disc again on the following point to cut the lead to 5-8, but turned it at mid- field. After scoring, Fury called time-out and then rolled off 5 breaks before we scored a meaningless fifth point. Our O touched the disc 21 times for 4 goals, and our D touched the disc 7 times for one break.\nAnd of course as all this was taking place there was Fury\u0026rsquo;s psyche: creative, unrelenting, unending. While Fury is not in-your-face and intimidating, they are constant and it is loud. If they\u0026rsquo;re not spelling something they\u0026rsquo;re clapping or singing, you know they love each other and you know they mean it — they\u0026rsquo;re not doing it for you. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing less than deliberate or casual about anything they do. When you had the disc three times to break, the third empty possession saw them go 70 yards for the score, and they immediately start singing. There\u0026rsquo;s really nowhere to hide and no ignoring it either.\nBy The Numbers\n0 to 5 Brute Squad: 5 goals on 10 possessions. 3 to 10 Brute Squad; their remaining 5 goals scored on 10 possessions. 11-15 final score. 2-5 Fury: 5 goals on 9 possessions. 4-10 Fury; their remaining 5 goals on 11 possessions. 5-15 final score. 3 to 5 Riot: 5 goals on 11 possessions. 6 to 10 Riot: their remaining 5 goals scored on 20 possessions. 10-15 final score. 2nd half numbers: 12 points scored between the two teams on 60, yes 60, possessions; and only four O1 goals.\n"

Everyone plays that role perfectly when push comes to shove. They don\u0026rsquo;t mess around against teams they know they will beat, and they bring it hard to teams that might have entertained thoughts of having a chance.\nIn the end, I think that the former is more important than the latter — anyone can decide to bring it in a big game, but the question is how much do they have left to bring? This became glaringly obvious in the heat, sun, and humidity of Florida this year, not to mention the wind of years previous. This year when other teams (mine included) bled points to teams they had beaten all season long, Fury was done with each game early and was already resting in the shade when others were playing into the cap. Over a 4-day tournament time is ridiculously important. I think the particular skills they showed were less on the field (though those, as always, were impeccable) and more off the field — preparation, role definition and mental toughness.\nCongratulations, yet again!\n"

  "content": "I was in a unique position at the championships last season: being employed by the UPA to follow the action and write daily recaps on the website\u0026rsquo;s results page for the Open Division. In this capacity I witnessed part of each game Chain was involved in, and as they progressed through the tournament I got to watch how they were able to attack so effectively against the other top teams.\nFirst of all, they like to huck it. Obvious right? Each team I spoke with talked about trying (and failing) to stop their hucks and force them to work the disc underneath. The players I spoke with said things like, \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re gonna make \u0026rsquo;em play small ball,\u0026rdquo; or, \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re going to look to poach deep off the weak side cutters,\u0026rdquo; or, \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re going to stop hucks with our straight up marks,\u0026rdquo; or, as one captain said, \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re just going to back \u0026rsquo;em, plain and simple.\u0026rdquo; The problem with all of these strategies was in the assumption that Chain would be \u0026ldquo;worse\u0026rdquo; at working it underneath.\nTeams seemed to start out forcing Chain back toward the disc, or \u0026ldquo;making them throw a lot of passes\u0026rdquo; in the beginning of the game. Chain handled this style of defense without batting an eye, and was content to take under cuts all the way up to the sideline. When you are throwing to players like Zip, Dylan, AJ, Wooten, Wilson, Cricket, etc., they are not going to be beaten back to this disc if they\u0026rsquo;re being played honest (forget about it if you\u0026rsquo;re backing them). Once Chain had gotten to within 10 or 15 yards of the goal line the defense would have to play honest, allowing Chain to dump, swing and score on consecutive throws just like that. I rarely witnessed them struggle on the end zone line, and Chain scored quickly with frightening efficiency.\nSo the Chain offense has now shown that it can score without issue if the defense plays against the huck. This becomes demoralizing. At some point during the game the defense would have to try something different, i.e. fronting down field, or changing your mark strategy. Now all of a sudden the deep space opens up, and hucks are being launched by experienced, strong throwers to some of the best receivers in Ultimate.\nChain\u0026rsquo;s offense proved to be incredibly adaptable. They could score in a number of ways, and intelligently took advantage of teams that tried to take away the huck from the beginning. Chain played it cool at first, and proved that they could score without throwing long. Then, when the opportunity presented itself, they unleashed the beast.\nOn top of this, Chain\u0026rsquo;s defense was incredible after the turn. The O unit\u0026rsquo;s defense shown during the weekend, consistently forcing turnovers and giving themselves more opportunities to score. Credit their grit, and refusal to give up any break.\n"

I\u0026rsquo;m not talking about Fury and Godiva\u0026rsquo;s dominance, I\u0026rsquo;m talking about a single little cut that is the backbone of both team\u0026rsquo;s offenses. It\u0026rsquo;s a cut I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen other teams (men\u0026rsquo;s or women\u0026rsquo;s) use. I remember watching Teens (Christine Dunlap) wreck people with this cut, getting wide open again and again and again, so it was a little weird to watch Fury doing the same thing.\nThe cut begins as a short in-cut from the middle of the field. (The set up differs a bit in Godiva\u0026rsquo;s vert and Fury\u0026rsquo;s ho.) The in-cut is angled just slightly to the inside-out lane. Then, at a point maybe eight yards off the disc, the cutter plants and goes almost horizontally to the open side. Wide open. Pretty typically, this cut is coming around 4-6 in the stall count, providing a nice secondary option up field before looking at the dump.\nThis cut raises so many questions for me. I used to think it was effective only because of the physical differences between the men\u0026rsquo;s and women\u0026rsquo;s game. I can\u0026rsquo;t imagine trying to make that cut on a Furious or Ring defender — they\u0026rsquo;d flatten you as you tried to come back across to the open side. The Condors ran a J-cut for years, but theirs was much longer and was designed to test the defenders determination. If you just gutted it out, you could shut it down. But if the effectiveness is because of the differences between men\u0026rsquo;s and women\u0026rsquo;s why aren\u0026rsquo;t more teams using this cut? Is it athleticism? Then why hasn\u0026rsquo;t Riot used it? Is it system? Why hasn\u0026rsquo;t anyone copied it? Is it talent? Everyone has players talented enough to make the cut and the throw is easy, it\u0026rsquo;s a 10 yard open side swing pass.\nAfter talking to Tully Beatty, Matty Tsang, and watching the video I think I have the answers I need about Fury, but not about Godiva.\n"

  "content": "As others have mentioned, it\u0026rsquo;s highly important to catch the pull whenever possible. In the Women\u0026rsquo;s game, far too many players let the pull hit the ground if it comes in at a hard angle. As a puller, I\u0026rsquo;ve learned to take advantage of this by working on big outside-in pulls to gain an extra second or two while the player stops a roll and picks up the disc, possibly gain field position if the player misreads how the disc will roll, and give the offense a wet disc to work with if there\u0026rsquo;s dew on the grass. All of that is negated if the offense simply catches the pull.\nWhen running a horizontal stack offense, teams I\u0026rsquo;ve played on will call three handlers and designate one as the person to receive the first pass in the center of the field. Either of the other two handlers will field the pull, depending on which side of the field the pull heads towards. The two side handlers need to communicate as soon as they get a read on the pull who will catch it. If I\u0026rsquo;m one of these side handlers catching the pull, I like to count down my catch \u0026ldquo;3\u0026hellip;2\u0026hellip;1\u0026rdquo; so that other players on the field know exactly when our offense gains possession and is off to the races. The handler who gets the disc centered to her should read how fast the defense is coming down and position herself such that she can gain as many easy, uncontested yards as possible with the first pass.\n\u0026ldquo;Amy, Betty, Claire handling.

  "issue": "027",
  "content": "Preface: Ever since I started playing competitive Ultimate, I have been on the D team. So, receiving the pull isn\u0026rsquo;t something that I have partaken in very often. That being said, I have done it and can give a viewpoint from a defensive standpoint.\nMost important and crucial part of receiving the pull is the reception. I mean pure and simple, having someone there to initially catch the disc. From an offensive standpoint, catching the pull is where the offense begins. This is analogous to the inbounds pass in basketball; if you can\u0026rsquo;t confidently, successfully inbound the ball, you are going to have some unnecessary turnovers. The offense wants to catch the disc and get it moving right away whether for a set play, or string, or just to gain easy ground before the defense sets up. Whether due to miscommunication or a lack of confidence in catching, a pull hitting soil is starting off on the wrong foot for an offensive team.\nIn terms of how many should be back for this procedure and where they are positioned is determined by what offensive structure your team uses. For a horizontal, I would typically have one back to receive the disc and then two secondary handler options which form a triangle from the initial reception. Behind this, downfield, would be the normal horizontal stack. Procedurally, I would have an outside handler receive the pull, hit one of the two upfield options, and fill in to the outside of the person they had just thrown to (figure provided). The main purpose of this is get the disc to the center of the field to help open up space. This also gives the handlers, and offense, a routine to follow. Psychologically, this is a good way to forget what has happened in the game up till now and get refocused on the current point; watch any professional tennis player before he/she serves and notice that they bounce the ball the same number of times before each serve, or watch a basketball player before a free throw.\nFor a vertical stack, I would maintain have one handler back to receive the pull and a handler upfield, in the middle, as a first option. From here, you can either fall into the offense, or follow the string called.\nLastly, I remember a quote from my previous captain, Jonathan Potts, that is meaningful in this circumstance.\n\u0026ldquo;A good puller is worth 2-3 breaks a game.\u0026rdquo;\nIf your offensive team can work out a system to make this statement irrelevant to your team, then I would say you know how to receive the pull.\n"

  "content": "First of all, I would be very intrigued to hear the Open authors\u0026rsquo; answers on this question because, for the most part, Women\u0026rsquo;s pulls do not involve a ridiculous amount of rocket science to field (or maybe I have been missing out on something for years).\nTypically, we will call a pull play where one person on the left side of the field fields the pull if it goes left and one person on the right side of the field fields the pull if it goes right. Therefore, within a second or two after the puller releases the disc, the appropriate player calls out that they will field the pull and feed it into a player that is in the center.\nIf at all possible, it is pretty advantageous to catch the pull. When it is windy — especially in Women\u0026rsquo;s Ultimate — it may even be necessary to sprint forward once the pull is thrown to try and catch it before it hits the ground. That also means that your whole offensive line needs to be sprinting forward as well. Also, it is smart to practice fielding rollers and stopping rollers from obviously advancing in a direction to your disadvantage — whether that be to the trap sideline or back towards your endzone.\n"

  "content": "The best offensive teams can get big yards from the first few passes off a pull, and immediately knock the defense on its heels. There are no shortage of ways to do this, and the best offenses I have been a part of have always had a few options for taking this advantage.\nIn all cases the critical first component is having a player who feels comfortable catching the pull and throwing the first pass. This person should feel confident catching passes while backing up, getting in front of rollers, and in general putting themselves in that position where they may make the mistake, and might not get noticed for doing their job correctly. So often I see the catcher shy away from a difficult catch, let the disc hit the ground, then gather it and throw the first pass. This second or two that is lost is a tremendous advantage to the defense.\nSome teams I have been on have a variety of plays to attack the sidelines or the middle of the field, and can work on isolations, or on group movement to create an advantage for the offense. In most cases these are very simple plays, and so really only require a bit of practice time to get familiar with, and a few scrimmages to get comfortable executing. Other teams have been very simple, with just one pull play and then an option in case that play doesn\u0026rsquo;t go off. Sometimes this simplicity is very helpful, but the simplicity also requires all the players to be aware of what is developing so they can execute the backup plan together. At any rate, there are a variety of options available to a team, and even a novice captain should be able to draw up one or two simple ones for his team, with a simple flood one side and execute a string of passes to set players being the most universal/basic.\nI think the only adjustment that needs to be made in response to wind would be to designate the side of the field that the play will be run to before the pull comes. By specifying the side of the field you can put your offense in the position where they have an easier reset, or where the deep throw is most favorable for the wind. In general, however, responding to the pull as it comes will be dynamic enough to keep the defense on their heels and give the offense the best possible chance to score by giving a well-designed play the most space to work with.\n"

  "content": "The key goal when receiving the pull is to get into your play/offense as quickly and safely as possible. A few thoughts on how to do this:\nUnless the pull is going out of bounds or a big blade in a nice wind, catch it and get it moving. If it\u0026rsquo;s a big blade, stop it as soon as it hits and do the same thing. The only situation which I can think of in which you would not want to do this is if the pull is going to hit and slide out of bounds AND the defense is already set up on all the people you might throw to. That\u0026rsquo;s pretty rare, so get it going.\nIf you are trying to get the disc to the center of the field (common in a horizontal offense), then it is a good idea to have that thrower start near the middle of your line on the pull, and the other two handlers lined up near the outsides. That way either one of them can receive the pull. As soon as it is determined who will receive the pull, the other handler must get into position so you have options. The defense, especially if they know your team, will work hard to stop your first option. You need the second option, and sometimes a third option. Just having this first pass option is not enough — you need to have an ability to run the play or your offense off of this.\nOne special option: We used to call this \u0026ldquo;X\u0026rdquo; and it would be called after the pull. If the pull was deep, and especially if it was windy and we were going upwind, the ‘option handler\u0026rsquo; could call \u0026ldquo;X.\u0026rdquo; This means that the option handler would receive the first pass and then pass it to the person who was supposed to receive that pass. This let us take two passes to move the disc. It\u0026rsquo;s a good option when the defense isn\u0026rsquo;t covering quickly or when you are worried about the wind.\nYour upfield players must get into position quickly. If they do this, you are basically already running your offense. You may define a first set that is different from your flow, but it is still key to get into it. If even a single player lags behind, that\u0026rsquo;s one defender who can mess up the works.\nHave a language. There should be clear communication as the pull comes in. Define who will say what and exactly what that person will say. For example, some teams will choose the side of the field to attack while the pull is in the air — if so, know who is calling that (is it the person to receive the first pass? the option?), know what to say (if you say \u0026ldquo;left\u0026rdquo; which side is that?), and know what the options are. Even just saying \u0026ldquo;You got time\u0026rdquo; makes a difference. The pull receiver can then think about one thing — catching the pull. When calling the offense/positions before the pull, it should be known who says what.\nGet some yards, but don\u0026rsquo;t stress about it. Try to get some yards on the first pass, but it is more important that this is a good, safe pass. There is no reason to push this one and try to get too much. This will dictate your setup. Your up-field players should plan to set up based on where the person receiving the first pass will be. This means that person needs to get to this spot quickly. The location will depend on the quality of the pull and the speed of the defense. I would also suggest that this person plan to get to a spot and then move back towards the thrower a bit. That gives a little more leeway for a mistake on the throw — that first pass can be harder than you think.\nLook! Never marry a setup. Look at the D.\n"

  "content": "I have traditionally posted to this website with answers that questioned the question instead of answered it. I feel that I owe Ben and Andy a single straightforward response.\nMy teams have traditionally fielded the pull with the three handlers. The \u0026ldquo;Catch,\u0026rdquo; not surprisingly, catches the pull. I am surprised how often capable players choose to let pulls hit the ground instead of catching them on the fly. I encourage attempting to catch all but the most vertical of pulls. The risk of dropping the pull, in my opinion, is overrated.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Catch\u0026rdquo; then throws to the \u0026ldquo;Hitch\u0026rdquo;. Before that throw happens, however, the \u0026ldquo;Hitch\u0026rdquo; has positioned himself on his preferred side of the field, where he plans on eventually throwing the disc. He announces this side of the field loudly to all of the players in the stack (i.e. \u0026ldquo;Play Left!\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Left Side!\u0026rdquo;). Note that in a horizontal stack, the \u0026ldquo;play side\u0026rdquo; is always in the middle of the field, and the \u0026ldquo;Hitch\u0026rdquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to communicate the \u0026ldquo;play side\u0026rdquo;.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important that the \u0026ldquo;Hitch\u0026rdquo; gain as many yards as possible without risking a block. Many first throws do not take advantage of this free yardage before the defense is set.\nThere is always a third handler who is neither called as the \u0026ldquo;Hitch\u0026rdquo; nor the \u0026ldquo;Catch\u0026rdquo;. The role of this handler is to provide a second option should a speedy defender take away the first pass. He typically goes on the opposite side of the \u0026ldquo;play side\u0026rdquo;. If the \u0026ldquo;Hitch\u0026rdquo; catches the first throw, the 3rd handler is now setting the stack. If a defender takes away the throw to the \u0026ldquo;play side\u0026rdquo;, the \u0026ldquo;Catch\u0026rdquo; can throw to the 3rd handler on the opposite side of the field for an attempt up this side of the field.\n"

  "content": "1. Face the mark. This classic piece of throwing technology dates back to the dawn of modern Ultimate when Windy City and NYNY ruled. The uneducated thrower looks upfield at the stack and they position their body to reflect this. When they want to throw a dump they have to turn 270 degrees, which is incredibly slow. (Or turn their back to the field, which is incredibly dumb.) By facing the mark, you shorten the turn to 180 degrees. If you want to throw open side, you merely step out and away from the mark for an easy release.\n2. Play off rhythm. All good defenders depend on the rhythm of the game and the offense to anticipate the action and the deny-dump mark is no exception. The marker is relying on you turning to the dump at a predictible point in the stall count (usually 5 to 7.) If you throw the dump on stalling 3 sometimes, they aren\u0026rsquo;t ready.\n3. Play fast. This is similar to playing off rhythm, but is a team strategy rather than an individual one. The deny-dump mark is dependent on the mark establishing. If you are releasing on stalling 1 or 2, they can\u0026rsquo;t ever set up. It\u0026rsquo;s only if you hold the disc up around 6, 7 or 8 that you\u0026rsquo;ll get in trouble.\n4. Develop arounds. Get your around throws quick and confident. The better they are, the better the marker has to be to take them away. Typically, the deny-dump mark relies on catching you by surprise and if you are quick and confident, you have beaten them before they realize they have to take you seriously.\n"

  "content": "When we\u0026rsquo;re facing a \u0026ldquo;rotated\u0026rdquo; mark paired with good up-line dump defense, we have to do a few things to win.\nFirst, we have to cut and clear decisively. The defensive tactic succeeds if it forces the handlers to \u0026ldquo;dance,\u0026rdquo; clogging the reset lane and creating uncertainty for the thrower. Even if the handlers have nowhere to run but towards the defense, they must run. Often times, the defense isn\u0026rsquo;t as strong as it looks and the handler can swim past the up-line defender, or the thrower can shimmy to open up the around-break throw.\nEven if the defense holds, the decisive handler movement will still expose a soft spot: the inside-out lane. There are a few ways to exploit it.\nA handler who makes a hard up-line cut can button-hook back towards the inside-out lane. A cutter \u0026ndash; either the first person in a vertical stack, or a far-side cutter in a horizontal stack) can step into the i/o lane. If their defender has rotated to take away the i/o, then often a cutter can make a hard juke and get open straight to the sideline. Regardless of who makes the cut, the thrower can increase his odds exponentially by pivoting aggressively. In this case, that means pivoting to get his hips past the marker\u0026rsquo;s hips. By using his body to seal the marker, the thrower creates a clean throwing path to the inside lane — either the marker must concede it, or he must foul, resulting in a free throw and a new 10 seconds. I hasten to add that I think this is a very good defensive strategy, worth adding to a team\u0026rsquo;s arsenal. Any time you can make a team resort to its second or third option, your defense is succeeding.\n"

  "content": "In framing this discussion, I think it is important to note that some teams have a static approach to shifting the mark, while others are more dynamic. In the static case, the mark starts off taking away more of the reset look only on the sideline, while giving up more of an angle downfield. In the dynamic case, the marker starts off with a conventional angle, but rotates with the marker when they turn to hit the dump.\nWith that said, whatever strategy you choose to adopt to combat this mark, your task will generally be easier if the thrower and cutters are actively looking to move the disc off the sideline as early as possible. Instead of waiting for a lane cut to develop, realize that your primary goal is to get the disc out of a situation where the defense has an advantage (they have the sideline to help them, and they have a cohesive defensive strategy to take advantage of this position).\nA static change in the marker\u0026rsquo;s position on the sideline generally means that everybody but the thrower needs to adjust their strategy. The downfield players need to realize that their defenders are not getting as much help from the mark as they used to, and need to be in a position to take advantage. For example, players in a stack, especially the one closest to the thrower, need to generate more opportunities for the thrower. If the mark shifts a great deal, the person at the front of the stack can basically cut as if they were a dump, and preferentially try and receive the disc on the break side.\nA dynamic change, where the marker is actively denying the thrower\u0026rsquo;s main target, be it downfield or to a reset, means the thrower will need to create and be ready to capitalize on different opportunities as they are presented. The main weakness of an active mark is the relative inability of the mark to tell where the real threat is located. For example, if a cut to the break side is a little tight, the thrower can move the mark and create a larger window by faking a throw to the dump.\n"

This strategy works especially well in windy conditions or against teams that primarily run a vertical stack. I am sure that other authors will talk about the mechanics of the thrower in this situation but the one thing that I want to emphasize in this situation is the role of the cutter (normally a handler) who is in the dump position.\nWhen a mark rotates 45 degrees to take away the backfield dump, the window for a flat forehand in the inside lane is opened. As a thrower, this is great but only half of the battle. In order to take advantage of this window, the dump cutter must actively become aware of this newly opened window. There are two cuts that I would recommend to take advantage of this window.\nThe traditional dump cut — cut upfield, stop and become open for a dump in the backfield is exactly what the defense wants you to do. To take advantage of the inside lane, the traditional cut should be modified by driving an additional 3-5 yards farther upfield so that you are coming out of your break in the newly opened IO window. This will allow an easy flat throw along the IO lane.\nThe second cut is equally effective and my personal favorite. Again, this cut relies on the dump cutter realizing that they are in a \u0026ldquo;no-dump\u0026rdquo; situation. The cutter begins the cut by going for the up-line (or post, 02, power position cut) at full speed. Once the dump cutter reaches the IO window, stop on a dime. Your defender will normally be out of position for 1-2 seconds allowing an easy flat throw along the IO lane.\n"

  "content": "The anti-reset mark can effectively make the backfield dump a very difficult throw. Here are a few ways to prevent this defense from making your life as a thrower difficult.\nFirst of all, the D is most effective on a high stall count when you are running out of time and options (and many teams will only shift their marks to take away the dump once the stall count gets high). Looking to your resetter very early lessens the chance that the anti-reset mark will be set in the first place. In a similar vein, faking and pivoting early and aggressively will make it less likely that your mark can tell when you\u0026rsquo;re actually looking for the reset.\nIf you do find yourself with an anti-reset mark and a dump that\u0026rsquo;s covered up the line, there\u0026rsquo;s a simple trick that you can use to make your remaining options seem much less daunting: turn your back to the sideline and then mentally rotate the field 90 degrees so that you now imagine your endzone of attack to be in the direction you are facing. The mark will now be a regular angled, force one-way mark, and the person at the front of the stack is now standing in the open side lane.\nChances are their defender may not have adjusted to the mark opening up your options to hit that front of the stack player. Make sure your reset handler and their defender stay out of the way, preferably by staying back for the dump so that the mark continues to force the same way. The front of the stack player is now in a good position to either make a cut on what is now the open side, or even better, simply wait for you to put a pass out straight in front of you for them to run onto. From the perspective of what the real field actually looks like, this pass will be a cross-field pass into the middle of the field. With a little bit of float on that throw, you can put it out in front of your target such that they run onto it with momentum towards the break side of the field, and their mark trailing them on the open side- great opportunity to a continuation yardage cut on the break side!\n"

This defense works best when it has the element of surprise behind it. However, like many defenses, if offenses recognize that this strategy is being used they can develop a plan to counter it.\nThe easiest thing to think about is what the defense gives up when they implement this strategy. The obvious thing is the inside-out throw that gets the disc off the line. Having an upfield cutter make a move back to the middle of the field after making a hard cut to the line will frequently be an easy way to take advantage. Another option is to shift the stack closer to the sideline so that there is more space to the inside-out side of the stack for the thrower to use and for cutters to cut.\nIf a team is determined to get the disc to the reset, one adjustment to make is to have the reset wait for a thrower-initiated throw. This keeps the throwing space more open for the thrower, giving larger room for error. If the reset moves early and winds up behind the disc on that sideline there is very little space for the thrower.\nFinally, when that mark moves around, there is really no pressure on the upfield huck. A patient thrower should be able to use this to get off an uncontested huck if he has the confidence to wait until late in the count.\n"

  "content": "Nothing earth-shattering here, but first and most important: the easiest way to get out of this situation is to avoid it. A good offense recognizes what the D is playing early (see the zone, see the clam, see everything). An anti- reset mark can be set up by the defense several throws ahead. A person sits in the lane, leaving the handler on the sideline open. It\u0026rsquo;s an obvious throw. The first way to avoid this is to have that receiver (the person who would be trapped) move towards the thrower. Often it is better to all but hand the disc to this person, avoiding the longer throw and the trap. Even better, the receiver can circle behind — resetting the count while moving upfield.\nThe second way to avoid this is to break the mark before you have to. When the defense drops the person in the lane, don\u0026rsquo;t be tempted — work the disc the other way.\nSometimes, you just can\u0026rsquo;t avoid going into the trap. In this case, I recommend shortening the count in your mind. If you like to look reset or swing at 6, then you are now thinking of doing it by 3. This often will help you get the disc off prior to the mark getting set. A side note — it\u0026rsquo;s important that the other players recognize that you are doing this — you need them to be looking for the throws quickly. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that you should panic. I\u0026rsquo;ve coached teams to think of this situation as \u0026ldquo;three looks.\u0026rdquo;\nLook 1 — you receive the disc and you start to turn — looking upfield and back to the middle. Your first look is back into the field, away from the trap sideline. Your priority is to gain yards, but avoid the trap.\nLook 2 — you continue to turn — looking almost straight up field (close or far).\nLook 3 — you look back into the same place as look 1. You basically have bounced your turn off of the sideline. Always looking upfield.\n"

Typically in these situations there is a flood of players close to you, as cutters come in for the bail or defenders sag a bit into the lane.\nI find it helpful in these situations to make a 90 degree turn and pretend I have a normal force mark moving horizontally, not vertically. Now, instead of looking at a garbled mess and a shrunken open side, I am looking at 40 yards with both an open side and a break opportunity. More times than not, there is chaos in the new open side but a decent throw available to the new break side — either an IO to someone coming into the middle of the field, or an angled throw (think hammer or blade) to a cutter whose defender is sagging in. Not only do these throws beat the anti-mark, they also often lean to additional yardage up the break side.\n"

  "content": "There are a few key tricks that I have found make an effective mark. Some are commonly talked about and pretty well agreed. I do think that not all of these are universally agreed. This is mostly a list of key points, rather than in depth on each one.\nThe first is mental. It\u0026rsquo;s very easy to relax when you get to a mark. It\u0026rsquo;s important to remind yourself that you are responsible for more of the field than any other single defender on the field. I see players lose this focus at the biggest points in the biggest games. There\u0026rsquo;s no trick to this: you simply can\u0026rsquo;t relax when you are marking; any good thrower will recognize that you have let down your guard. The more intense you are, the better your mark. Sidelines can be key in this. Get on the marker—provide information about what\u0026rsquo;s going on, but don\u0026rsquo;t just let the marker relax. This isn\u0026rsquo;t the time rest.\nThe second is also mental. As a marker, you cannot do everything. Do not try. It\u0026rsquo;s very easy at the highest levels to start to think you can do more than you can. The downfield defender that spends too much time worrying about other players usually gets beat. The same is true for the marker. If you worry about trying to block the thrower from getting the disc to the whole field, you will likely not stop anything. You will be at the mercy of the throwers fakes. I usually tell players that you can stop 90° of the field, and you can harass throws in a little more (maybe 45-60° more). But you cannot stop a good thrower from throwing into even half of the field. In the diagram, T is thrower and M is marker, and the force is backhand. The dark blue is the area that you should block—definitely. You should try to harass throws in the light blue, but not at too much risk to your dark blue area.\nFigure No. 1\nThe third is positioning. I believe that most marks, even at all but the very top levels, are too far away from the thrower. It seems to be common practice to back up when there\u0026rsquo;s a risk of, or experience with, getting broken. Typically, movement (being on your toes, bouncing with the thrower pivots) does a better job of keeping you from giving up that throw. It\u0026rsquo;s important to have good balance and body position (arms low, knees over feet).* As a rule, I try to be about 18\u0026quot; to 2\u0026rsquo; from the thrower. Sometimes even closer. This is a change from what beginners or even intermediate players are taught, but it\u0026rsquo;s critical throughout.\nThe fourth is mental—again. As a marker, I want the thrower thinking about me. I know that I am rarely aware of the marker when I\u0026rsquo;m throwing. When I\u0026rsquo;m not aware of the marker it makes me very, very comfortable. Since I don\u0026rsquo;t want the thrower comfortable when I\u0026rsquo;m marking, I will change things. I will change the volume I\u0026rsquo;m counting. I will vary my distance a bit between stall counts—shifting forward and back, and between marks. I will sometimes move my arms more and sometimes less. I\u0026rsquo;ll yell different things to the defenders around me.\n* Zaslow and Parinella wrote a great guide to marking in \u0026ldquo;Ultimate Techniques and Tactics.\u0026rdquo; Balance and arm position is key in this—I\u0026rsquo;d suggest giving it a read if you haven\u0026rsquo;t. I didn\u0026rsquo;t cover items like balance, arm position, or impact of field position. It\u0026rsquo;s covered very well in their book.\n"

  "title": "Beyond The Fundamentals",
  "author": "Ben van Heuvelen",
  "issue": "025",
  "content": "Beyond the fundamentals of marking—getting low with the hips, staying balanced, keeping arms wide—here are a few \u0026ldquo;advanced fundamental\u0026rdquo; techniques.\n1. Chin up, eyes on the chest. My hand is much more likely to find its way in front of the disc when I\u0026rsquo;m only \u0026ldquo;looking\u0026rdquo; with my peripheral vision. To be honest, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure why this works so well. In part, I think it\u0026rsquo;s because good throwers use disc fakes to get you out of position. If you\u0026rsquo;re not looking at the disc, you\u0026rsquo;re less likely to get faked out by it. Also, there is so much useful visual information to take in—where the thrower is looking, where his chest is facing, whether he\u0026rsquo;s gripping forehand or backhand—and you can only see all of that by using peripheral vision.\n2. Step backward to prevent the break. Say I\u0026rsquo;m forcing forehand, and a thrower tries to break me with an inside-out forehand. If I lunge sideways or forward, closing the distance between me and the thrower, then he has a chance to reach forward and release the disc past my hand. Against a good thrower, I have no chance at a block, and he\u0026rsquo;ll probably draw a foul, too. So, instead, I want to open my hips and lunge laterally and backwards. I deny him the ability to release the disc past my arm, I don\u0026rsquo;t let him draw the foul, and I give myself an extra quarter of a second to locate the disc and move my hand to block it.\n3. Straight-up mark. A surprising number of club players put on poor straight-up marks because they seem to think the purpose of a straight-up mark is to get a hand-block. The strategic purpose of a flat mark, however, is usually that we want to prevent throws to the middle of the field—forcing throwers to spray discs wide, into positions where the defense can use the sideline as an extra defender. My rule of thumb for a good flat mark is \u0026ldquo;mirror shoulders.\u0026rdquo; At all times, my shoulders will be flush with the thrower\u0026rsquo;s shoulders.\n4. The half-flat mark. If a thrower (or a team) is hucking successfully, and/or if they\u0026rsquo;re beating us with yardage-gaining breaks, one way to respond is by adjusting the angle of our marks. In the basic forehand force we all learned on the first day of ultimate practice, the marker sets up at a 45-degree angle to the sideline—putting himself in a position where he\u0026rsquo;s able to shift to take away either the inside-out forehand or the around backhand. With the half-flat mark, the thrower concedes the yardage-losing around throw. He sets up entirely perpendicular to the sideline, as if he were marking straight-up—except here he\u0026rsquo;ll shuffle a half step to his right (assuming a forehand force), such that his left shoulder is even with the thrower\u0026rsquo;s chin. As the thrower pivots, the marker will maintain this relative positioning. There are three advantages to this tactic: A. The marker can respond to a \u0026ldquo;no huck\u0026rdquo; with a half-step lateral shuffle, easily and quickly, without having to rotate around or lunge over the thrower. B. The marker doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to move as much to take away the inside-out throw. C. Although the marker is conceding an around pass to the backfield, he is more effectively taking away a yardage- gaining around pass.\n5. Be unpredictable. Vary your distance from the thrower, keep your hands frantic, add an extra half-second to your stall count (\u0026ldquo;Stalling one, two, two and a half, three\u0026rdquo;*)—anything, within the limits of legal play and good sportsmanship, to get your thrower thinking more about your mark and less about his throw.\n* I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t use this particular one outside of summer league.\n"

  "content": "I really enjoy marking—particularly in the zone of a 1-3-3. Marking is a very important part of the game that often goes unnoticed or is an afterthought in defensive play. Teams usually pay some lip service to marking strategy (forcing flick or middle or straight-up), but that tends to be about it. Unfortunately, common practice is that the marker will rest on the mark. They use the mark as a chance to get their breath and prepare for another defensive run. This is a big mistake and passes up a great opportunity to create added defensive pressure.\nI am not tall—at 5'9\u0026quot; I do not have a huge wingspan to shut down throwing options. However, I do have a few little tricks when it comes to marking to improve my success rate.\nMy favourite strategy is to start counting calmly\u0026hellip;stalling 1, 2, 3, 4, and then once the count starts to get higher, I start to count louder and more frantically. By the time I get to stalling 9, and hopefully 10, the thrower is freaked out and everyone knows the count. This makes it much harder for the thrower to call a \u0026ldquo;fast count\u0026rdquo; when everyone on the field has heard it. For those who play goaltimate, you understand how this can work as stall outs are much more common. I believe that this is not really because of the shorter amount of time (5 seconds), but because everyone on the field hears the stall count—taking away the cheap \u0026ldquo;fast count\u0026rdquo;.\nAnother little trick that I like is to start close to the thrower at stall 1-3 and then back up as the count gets higher. This eliminates the cheap foul call at a high count to bail a thrower out. When I say back up—I really step off so that the thrower cannot even reach out and touch me.\nWhen marking a very adept low break-force thrower I back up a lot as well. This cuts down on their throwing angle and helps me take away down field cuts. Some will argue that you need to be close to the thrower, but I have found over the years that top level throwers will have no trouble stepping through a close mark, throwing a perfect throw, and getting insurance on a cheap foul call.\nFor hammer throwers, you need to be very close and in their face so that they cannot survey the field effectively.\nFor huckers, you need to be very close as well—in their \u0026ldquo;kitchen\u0026rdquo;, so to speak, to prevent the big wind up and release.\nFinally, and maybe most importantly, I have found as a marker I can help play downfield defense. All you have to do is keep half an eye on the downfield cutters. You can see when someone is coming in wide open, and your added vision of the field makes that throw more difficult. This works the best at a high count on a handler. You know that the thrower has committed to the dump. Instead of standing like a lump \u0026ldquo;forcing flick\u0026rdquo;, get active and help your teammate shut down the dump. Remember that you only have to be within 10 feet of the thrower to be \u0026ldquo;marking\u0026rdquo;. You can play a lot of defense in a 10-foot radius.\n"

  "author": "Brett Matzuka",
  "issue": "025",
  "content": "The most common mark you see on the frisbee field is what I would define as a preventative mark. The mark has each arm extended out fully, explicitly placed to take away a specific throw. This is a useful mark as it does prevent the intended throws and it is seen at every level of frisbee (see photo 1). However, though it is useful, it has certain disadvantages. It allows the thrower to know which throws you are trying to take away before they even attempt to throw or fake. This will allow the thrower to find the gaps in the mark and exploit them. Looking over the Japanese mark, you can see that the thrower has yet to initiate a throwing motion, or fake, and the mark already has her arms fully extended. The thrower can now find the gaps and use these for release points in her throw.\nPhoto 1\nWhat I find helps to apply more pressure to throwers on most levels is what I would call a deceptive mark. Instead of fully extending your arms out in a way that gives the thrower knowledge on what you are trying to prevent, keep your arms closer to your sides, ready to pounce out once the thrower has committed to a throwing motion. As can be seen, Thomas Ward of NC State, and Ring of Fire, has his arms close to his sides and ready to strike once the thrower has committed to an option. Since they are tight to his side while the thrower is not in a throwing motion, this does not allow the thrower to find holes and gaps in the arms to exploit as before. While it does not guarantee that you will prevent the respective throw you are trying to stop every time as the previously mentioned mark will (having your arm constantly up to prevent a high release will certainly stop it, but may give up other throws), it will force the thrower to work harder to get a throw off (they may try to throw a inside break backhand and your hand appears, which makes them work harder by faking multiple times to get the option they want).\nPhoto 2\nIn general, a foot block is not earned by constantly holding your foot in the air where you think they will release it, but by executing right when they enter into their throwing motion. This same idea can be utilized with your arms, and is useful, to apply more pressure to the thrower.\n"

  "title": "Team Marking",
  "author": "Charlie Reznikoff",
  "issue": "025",
  "content": "When marking, face to face, one-on-one with your opponent, you are more closed off from the game around you than at any other moment in Ultimate. This leads some markers to try for too much, going for every block. Others miss opportunities to help their teammates by adhering too closely to the force. Effective marking requires a balance between these extremes. One trick to achieving this balance (and knowing when to take a risk on the mark) is glancing over your shoulder at the oncoming cuts. A quick look behind you helps you not to bite on fakes. You can prioritize which throws to take away. You\u0026rsquo;ll have the opportunity to help a roasted teammate. And you\u0026rsquo;re much more likely to get a block.\nA common example of this occurs after a deep pass is caught near the end zone. The defender, just taken deep, is often frantic, frustrated, and wants to get the defense personally. He may mark wildly, lunging for every fake. In doing so he makes end zone defense impossible for his teammates, and makes a goal more likely. Conversely, some defenders will mark conservatively, doing only what was agreed-upon before the point. Yet in this scenario, cutters commonly have a step on their defenders and conservative marking nearly guarantees a score. A well-timed strike of the mark would save the goal.\nIn Ultimate, finding the cutters and adjusting the mark accordingly gives the defense a huge advantage. Ideally the mark is not a one-on-one match up, but team defense, like a zone, requiring communication and vision.\n"

  "issue": "025",
  "content": "There are a lot of marking tidbits I\u0026rsquo;ve heard and dispensed over the years. I find myself repeatedly coming back to four in particular. Two of these pieces of wisdom have come from amazing coaches, one is from a legendary point-block machine, and one is from observations of what makes the biggest difference in my own marking.\nFrom Jennifer \u0026ldquo;JD\u0026rdquo; Donnelly (while coaching Stanford Superfly): Your mark should take into account body mechanics and reaction time. Keeping your center of gravity low (bending at the knees, not the waist) helps you stay balanced on the mark. You can move your feet quicker if your weight is on the balls of your feet rather than your heels. It is quicker to move your arms upwards than downwards. It is easier to move your arms quickly from a neutral, relaxed position than from a fully extended, outstretched position. You can\u0026rsquo;t take away a throw from below your knees with your hands while still staying balanced (use your feet instead). You\u0026rsquo;ll have more time to react to a throw if your hands are in the same plane as your body rather than in-front of your torso.\nFrom Matty Tsang (while coaching Fury): A good mark \u0026ldquo;sets the table\u0026rdquo; for your teammates to get blocks downfield. Actually, as a very team-D-oriented thinker, he emphasizes that playing good D anywhere on the field can help your teammates get blocks. As it applies to marking, setting the table for your teammates means holding the force (or at least making break throws very hard) at a minimum and ideally also pressuring big open-side throws to influence the thrower into throwing a pass that was not what she initially envisioned. If you do your job on the mark, you allow your teammates the opportunity to make plays downfield on passes that are less than perfectly executed or are thrown somewhere the D is anticipating. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to get a point-block to generate a turnover.\nFrom Mike Whitaker (during a clinic with Team USA): Move your feet according to a \u0026ldquo;marking triangle\u0026rdquo; to best hold the force. Whit is an excellent marker, partly because of amazing reflexes, but more importantly because he moves his feet well to the positions that are most likely to help him shut down the break side. The marking positions that can best stop breaks are NOT along a straight line, in one plane with the marker\u0026rsquo;s initial body positioning.\nInstead of exclusively shuffling back and forth along a straight line, the best markers vary the distance between themselves and the thrower (often dependent on the stall count). In order to stop yard-gaining breaks, Whit advocates using a drop-step shuffle to hit the corners of an imaginary triangle behind the mark. By dropping back and out to the side, the marker prevents a good thrower from simply stepping through the mark for a break and also allows the marker time to react to any break-mark throw that is attempted. I only wish I\u0026rsquo;d started practicing this marking triangle technique earlier. My personal marking mantra: Work your hardest while on the mark. There is never a time for resting while you\u0026rsquo;re on the mark and the disc is in play.\nSometimes working hard on the mark is physical and sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s mental, but it should always be intense. You should have your most fierce focus of the point while marking. You should be constantly ready to adjust and readjust the positioning of your body and limbs. You should be ready to move your feet with quick agility and engage your core to maintain balance whether you\u0026rsquo;re marking the first pass of a point or a pass after twenty minutes of a point. My best marking has always been after reminding myself that marking should be hard work.\nEach of these pieces of advice can be tweaked according to the angle of the force and other specific situations, like a particular thrower. For instance, when marking a thrower like Kath Ratcliff, who has a quick high release backhand, you would want to keep your right hand higher than usual (slightly higher than shoulder level). But you would still want to keep your arm in a relaxed position and you\u0026rsquo;d still want to drop-step back while trying to cut off that throw. Alternatively, if you\u0026rsquo;re guarding a thrower like Julie Baker, who has a ridiculously low-release flick, you might take a general step off to prevent her from stepping past you, and you would need to be prepared to flash your left foot to stop her signature throw. But you would still need to stay balanced and move your feet. On the other hand, if you\u0026rsquo;re trapping an insecure thrower on the forehand sideline, you might eschew drop-stepping against the unlikely threat of a yard-gaining backhand break and instead shuffle to the right, parallel to the sideline to make even a yard-losing backhand break less easily executed. But you would still need to maintain your intense focus and readiness for any break throw she might attempt. Paying attention to the preferred breaks of throwers can certainly help prepare you for setting a killer mark.\n"

  "content": "When the disc is dead, always check behind your back to see where the first threats are and position yourself to take those away most effectively. It\u0026rsquo;s the one chance you have to see what\u0026rsquo;s about to happen behind you before you set up your mark—use it!\nI try to think of my arms and legs separately as a \u0026rsquo;two-pronged\u0026rsquo; defense. Think of your arms as being on a separate vertical plane from your legs, so that the thrower has to get through 2 vertical planes of extremities rather than just one. Stand in marking form, with your arms outstretched, then step your break side leg slightly back. Now when you are marking, it is psychologically harder for the thrower to throw under your arm because they can\u0026rsquo;t tell where your leg is (they know it\u0026rsquo;s farther back than your arm).\nVary your distance from the thrower. If you are always in the same place the thrower has 10 seconds to plan out a way to break your mark. I like to start out marking closer, and then as the count gets higher I move slightly backwards, and eventually stand up straighter. This minimizes the chances that I\u0026rsquo;ll foul the thrower on a high stall count, changes the way in which they have to throw in order to break me midway through the stall count, and standing up taller puts me in better position to stop Hail Mary hucks on stall 9.\nAs a mark, you can\u0026rsquo;t take away everything. Study your thrower. Try to mark up on the same person over and over again, figure out what they like to do best, and then take that away. Force them to throw something they are slightly less comfortable with. Hopefully that throw will be less well-calibrated and less expected from their teammates and result in a few miscues.\n"

  "title": "Tricks Of The Trade",
  "author": "Patrick Mooney",
  "issue": "025",
  "content": "As a player who is in all honesty not the most gifted and speedy athlete in the game, getting defensive turnovers with monster layouts and big skies is not always the best strategy for me. I learned early on however that I can still have a huge effect on the defensive side of the game by simply focusing on putting on a solid mark on the player I\u0026rsquo;m covering (or trying to cover) once they have the disc. Here are some of the tricks I use and some of those I\u0026rsquo;ve seen others use with success.\n1. Don\u0026rsquo;t use the marks as a time to rest. Be active.\nToo many players, at all levels of the game, use the mark as an opportunity to rest for 10 seconds in order to conserve some energy for their next trip out into the lanes. The trick is to do both; catch your breath while marking hard. Deep breaths and energy recovery and a focused mark are not exclusive events. Each stall count affords you a great chance to take a nice deep breath and all the while you can keep those arms and legs moving.\n2. Consider your distance from the thrower.\nOne of the things I focus on during every marking opportunity is controlling my distance from the thrower. It\u0026rsquo;s a lesson I learned early on playing college ultimate against more experienced guys who would tell me to stop dry humping their leg for 10 seconds every time I marked them. I would crash the mark and stay in close while clutching and grabbing at the disc every opportunity I had thinking that an aggressive mark is a good mark. This isn\u0026rsquo;t always true and often leads to foul calls all game, or at inopportune times late in the stall count. Here is my default strategy for maintaining proper distance now that I have a bit more experience:\nEarly stalls (1-3): Crash the mark and keep your distance close. Some might say this is a blatant infraction of the rules, but at the elite level it is common and widely accepted. Good throwers will take this as an opportunity to take an uncontested shot and good defensive players use this as a way to take away an easy look and to slow the offense down a bit.\nMiddle stalls (4-7): Back up a bit and get active. Move your feet and hands and act like the disc is a fly and your hands and feet are fly swatters. Be aware of your surroundings and the throwers best options, and do your best to make them think twice.\nHigh stalls (8-10): Give extra room to avoid a crafty veteran player from looking to generate contact and a foul but don\u0026rsquo;t stop applying pressure especially against weaker throwers. These are the stalls where I feel a marker can be the most dynamic.\n3. Know your opponent. Studying a team, and more specifically the exact match-ups you are going to have against a given team in a given game, to gain knowledge of throwing habits as well as strengths and weaknesses in advance will help you a great deal in planning your marking strategy. When I watch UltiVillage clips (shout out to Rob) or when I\u0026rsquo;m playing these teams and players these are some of the things I consider:\nQ1: Does this team or player rely on making big breaks to run their offense?\nQ2: Does he/she look for contact and cheap fouls at high counts?\nQ3: Does he like his flick bomb or his backhand?\nQ4: Do they like to throw and go, or do they want to hold the disc and look for a bigger and better option?\nQ5: Are they a strong or weak thrower?\nWhen you start to be more thoughtful and proactive when it comes to marking you can start to apply a great deal of pressure with your mark—no matter who you are playing against.\n4. Don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to be more dynamic on the mark.\nAt the start of every point of every game we are told what the force is, and as anyone playing elite ultimate knows, good team defense relies on holding that force. However, too often I see players give up easy throws at late counts just because they are doing what they \u0026ldquo;should do.\u0026rdquo;\u0026quot; Some of the best markers, in my opinion, will abandon the force at late stall counts and high- pressure situations to stay with the thrower and try to take away his best option in an attempt to make them turn up field at stall 8 and throw something they didn\u0026rsquo;t want to. This is especially true of weaker throwers. Use your brain, be smart and take chances to force high-pressure looks for the offense. Force your opponent to make the one throw he is least comfortable making.\nIf every player on a team marks effectively, forcing the opposition to make numerous high pressure decisions and throws, it allows all the other players on their team to have a better chance at making the big play or their opposition to make a bad one. Good team defense begins with the mark.\n"

  "title": "Two Simple Steps",
  "author": "Matt Dufort",
  "issue": "025",
  "content": "Marking consists of two simple steps: knowing the threats, and denying the threats. While the specifics will depend on how your team decides to play defense, the ideas below will apply in nearly all situations.\nStep 1: Know the threats.\nThe best way to adjust your mark is to anticipate what the offense wants to do. If you can read the offense, you can take away the throws that would help them the most. Here are the key things to know:\n1 Position on the field. Where you are on the field changes the threats, and should change how you mark. Every time you set up a mark, you should take a moment to get your bearings on the field.\n2. Thrower\u0026rsquo;s abilities. If you\u0026rsquo;re covering a team\u0026rsquo;s top thrower, you\u0026rsquo;re likely to be focused on stopping hucks and dangerous break throws. But if you\u0026rsquo;re marking a good athlete with weak disc skills, the biggest threat may just be that they get the dump off. Pay attention to their comfort with the disc, the throws they\u0026rsquo;ve made before, and what their teammates look for when they have the disc. If it\u0026rsquo;s someone you match up against frequently, watch video to learn their moves, and visualize how you\u0026rsquo;ll stop those moves.\n3. Position of other players on the field. Knowing where the cutters are can make marking much simpler. You don\u0026rsquo;t have eyes in the back of your head. But take a quick glance around as you set up the mark, keep an eye out for cutters in your peripheral vision, and get your teammates on the sideline to tell you where the potential receivers are.\n4.Reading the thrower. For all but the best throwers, it\u0026rsquo;s possible to tell when and where they\u0026rsquo;re going to put a throw up. Focus on their eyes and hips—few people have effective no-look throws, and if their hips move, the rest of their body will too. DO NOT focus on the movement of their head, shoulders or hands—these are the easiest parts of the body to fake with.\nStep 2: Deny the threats.\nIf you followed the advice above, you should have a pretty good idea of how the thrower can hurt you. The next step is to use that knowledge to deny the threats.\n1. Establish and maintain proper positioning. Stay low and active as you approach, and set up so you can prevent the thrower\u0026rsquo;s most dangerous options. With a great thrower, this may be tight and flat to prevent the huck, or low and a yard away to deny quick breaks. With a weaker thrower, you can more safely attack the open side and dump throws.\n2. Hedge your bets. You want to prevent the thrower\u0026rsquo;s best options, without exposing your defense to even bigger problems. Don\u0026rsquo;t jump so hard on one fake that you let off an easy break throw. You can\u0026rsquo;t stop everything, so focus on preventing the throws that would hurt your defense the most, while making other options a bit more difficult.\n3. Be unpredictable. A good thrower will see a mark\u0026rsquo;s weaknesses and exploit them. By constantly changing things up, you can keep the thrower guessing and force them to look off throws they\u0026rsquo;d otherwise take. Vary your distance from the thrower, your side-to-side positioning, and how you move your hands. Don\u0026rsquo;t just follow the thrower\u0026rsquo;s moves—it may take them a couple fakes, but they\u0026rsquo;ll burn you. I tend to split a 10-second stall count into 3 or 4 chunks, and change up my mark every 2-3 seconds. I\u0026rsquo;ll often start tight and active for 1-3, back off to deny the breaks at 4-5, approach again at 6-7 to make them uncomfortable, then step back a bit to avoid the dreaded stall-9 foul call.\n4. Go for the kill. In elite ultimate, turnovers can be hard to come by. When you\u0026rsquo;re marking a weaker thrower, when the stall count gets high, or if the disc is in a bad position (deep in the end zone or trapped downwind), you need to take advantage of it. Get active, attack every throw, and don\u0026rsquo;t make anything easy. Even if you don\u0026rsquo;t get a point block, chances are good you\u0026rsquo;ll force a turnover.\n"

To really learn about Justice, I want to find criminals, victims, cops, defense attorneys, and those falsely accused. I want to get into what it means to live with Justice, or to live without it.\nI think that if someone tries to tell you in one sentence what Spirit is then all you have learned is that this person doesn't understand the Idea. It's more complicated than that, and it is complicated because some parts of you might want to live with that Idea, and others don't. What matters, to me, is trying to understand how the people in the mix, the people actually dealing with the ramifications and who have the most to gain and lose from it.

  "issue": "024",
  "content": "I usually try to write on the presented topic from a objective and scientific viewpoint, however, due to the nature of this topic, this will be rather subjective and opinionated. Also, much of this is a comparison to tennis since that is where I have participated in the highest levels of competition prior to frisbee.\nGrowing up learning the sport of Ultimate in Australia, my viewpoint of SOTG comes from a more global perspective of competition. Now playing for Ring of Fire, I feel I have witnessed a large spectrum of viewpoints on the topic of SOTG, from nonexistent and unnecessary to dressing up to the theme of the team, uncontesting any questionable calls, and giving out gifts at the end of the game.\nFor me, personally, I find that Ultimate and tennis share a lot of the same competitive features. SOTG really just refers to competing at the highest level presented while still retaining the utmost respect for the competition. How you define retaining respect is now the key feature and how that is displayed is at the crux of the issue. In tennis, even at the highest levels (pre-professional), you make your own line calls. Whether in a heated battle for break point in a match to make the final, or blowing some chump off the court, 99% of the tennis matches I was a part of consisted of the players doing their best to make the right call at every opportunity, whether or not it cost them the match. From Hawaii to Australia, this phenomena is consistent in every tennis match I participated in. It is true that 1% (1 match in every 100) of the time there was a match where this was not the case and the opponent tried to take advantage to obtain a victory, but people are human and this trait will appear (see below), so moving on.\nI found the reason that this high level of respect and sportsmanship was consistent in tennis is because each match, not just was your game on display, but your character, valor, and nobility as a person was on display. It seems to be understood amongst tennis players that it is better to challenge yourself to become a better player and improve every shot, than to make a bad call at the expense of the opposition just to win a single point. It may not be due necessarily to respect for the opposition as much as a desire to become the best you personally can be, and a respect for the sport, a game based upon a struggle with oneself mentally and physically to overcome all adversities. However, because all players seem to take this to heart, a respect for the opposition is inherent since each player knows that the other player is also challenging themself to be the best they can be in the face of every adversity.\nThis respect can be seen even at the professional level of tennis when a player claps when his opposition betters him on the field of battle, or when a player wins on a technicality (let court) and holds his hand up apologetically. This is the heart of SOTG; it isn\u0026rsquo;t about goofing around or giving your opposition the edge every opportunity, or so on, but about respecting those that share the field of battle with you and displaying it appropriately. Making the right calls no matter the circumstance, congratulating someone on a great play whether they bested you or not, playing at your highest level even if you are bageling a team, these are ways of showing respect, and inherently, SOTG.\nI find that this is the world view on how SOTG is perceived. For example, at the World Ultimate and Guts Championships in even the tightest, most significant games, teams came together afterwards in a circle to show appreciation for the fight that each team put forth.\nI think this is consistent with the top teams and lowest level teams in the US; they would rather expect more from themselves, improve their personal games and win on their own accord, than take advantage and obtain victory through false means. For example, at ECC, when Ring was playing Furious in the game to 5, Andrew Lugsdin gave up his bobbled catch in the end zone when we called it down and a player on the sideline with the best view also called it down. He easily could have sent it back or even argued it up, but he respected us, the sport, and himself enough to expect more from himself and his team than take advantage of the situation. This, to an extent, is what makes the top teams the elite teams, they don\u0026rsquo;t make excuses but expect the best from themselves.\nIt is true, there are still a few guys on each elite team that abuse SOTG and show no respect to the opposition (much like that 1% of tennis matches), however, they are usually the minority in the elite ranks in the US. For example, playing Boston at ECC, there was a foul call on a catch and it was contested and sent back, a single Boston player on the sideline started to yell, swear, and berate our player for the call, though all the players on the field, and the sideline, had already respected the outcome and accepted it. This sort of outburst never resorts in any benefit for either team (can you remember a time your teammates verbally assaulted another team and the call and game went smoother?), but can find one player of this sort on each team. However, as stated, this is the minority on the elite teams.\nMuch like the elite teams, the low level teams also exhibit a high level of SOTG. This again is due to their focus upon improving themselves than worrying about a questionable call. The one place where SOTG seems to lack in the US is in the second tier teams. The teams that feel they deserve some recognition and praise for their work, that are always a few spots from making nationals. I find that they take a call as a personal gesture of disrespect and an insult directed at their game. They are the ones that have lost perspective about why they play the game; they don\u0026rsquo;t expect the best of themselves, but find excuses why someone got the better of them. A call cost them the game, or their pride gets in their way, they no longer play with the expectation of perfection from themselves, but have deluded themselves into believing that they have worked as hard as they can and no one deserves to ever beat them. This is where SOTG fails to be present because these players have already entered the game without respect for the opposition. They believe victory is all that matters and that they deserve it irregardless of play. This is where SOTG falls short.\nWith regards to how teams I have been a part of dealt with Spirit, the younger players would always refer to the respected players on anything questionable.\n"

Every game is a battle and every game is intense. In my opinion, it is when the UPA Series starts that Spirit matters most.\nThe best players in the game can play at an incredibly high level without compromising their personal integrity or the reputation of their team. I think that sometimes Spirit of the Game is mistaken for not contesting calls or not being willing to make a call, but really it is honoring your opponents and yourself by playing 100% and making calls if true violations or fouls occur. I really enjoy the moments in Ultimate when someone makes a call and then after a quick discussion realizes it wasn\u0026rsquo;t the right call and takes it back. I am a true believer that SOTG is something that sets our sport apart from others and for the better. I am proud to be able to say that I have played at the highest level of this sport without the assistance of referees.\nI know, for me personally, there is something very rewarding about battling with an opponent and then turning around and giving them a high five when they just skyed you in the endzone or got a sick layout D. I haven\u0026rsquo;t experienced that feeling in other sports growing up and it is moments like those that make me feel incredibly proud to be an Ultimate player.\n"

  "content": "This topic is not useless, but I find that my thoughts on it are fairly disconnected.\nA phrase that reminds us to respect each other and the game makes sense even if it is not as effective as some would like preventing players from cheating or acting like jerks. We are really just codifying the idea that Ultimate players should practice good sportsmanship, That has value, I hope.\nA lot of people discover Ultimate after some bad experience with another sport. Turned off by the win at all costs attitude of little league or youth soccer they find the culture of Ultimate inviting. To some degree Spirit of the Game helps us maintain that valuable difference, even if those who battle for a national championship only think of spirt as a kind of anachronism.\nBut as much as possible I hope the top teams try to invest a little preparation time into playing with good spirit.\nFor the record, the team I help coach, Ironside, sets as one of our main goals to be considered a fair team, a team our opponents want to play. Honestly, I don\u0026rsquo;t know how we are doing. The scoreboard supplies a clear metric of whether or not we win a game. How we are doing in terms of earning the respect of other teams is harder to tell. No doubt we have made some dubious calls. This year and last we have had a few tiff\u0026rsquo;s against various rivals. Our fault? Theirs? Depends on who you ask. No matter, I assume it is on us to do better and have tried to make myself more accountable for this to the leadership of other teams. Not easy though. What happens on the field should (I think) be the player\u0026rsquo;s responsibility and, like everyone else, I often see with biased eyes. When I hear my players say something incendiary I get on them right away but every once and a while its me saying \u0026ldquo;are you serious\u0026rdquo; with that call. We all have to police each other in this respect.\n(I am a big fan of the Farriker award, but not sure what team spirit ratings do. Maybe Farriker award nominees should have to put in the spirit score for their own team?)\nIt\u0026rsquo;s worth remembering that there is a difference between cheating and not knowing.\nWe all put a ton of time, effort, and money into what we do and all that makes the dragging toe or little bump that would never get noticed in summer league seem huge in late October. We all want shape the reality in our favor. Of late, I think top club teams have come to recognize this and are ever more comfortable just going to the observer. That we are getting more and more qualified observers helps, obviously.\nYou may not know John Bar or Stu, but there was a time when everyone in Ultimate knew those guys. They went to every tournament and the sport was small enough for such guys to be at every party. (Is there a spot in the hall for them?) It was one of them who said that the arguments in an Ultimate game were not what kept us from getting on T.V. In fact, if we want higher ratings, what we should do is get a microphone and camera in on the arguments. Fans would love that. And unfortunately, that\u0026rsquo;s probably correct.\nLast note, from the showcase game at ECC. Ben Wiggins burns his defender (a former teammate, Seth Crockford) up the line. As he does so, he says something excitedly to the effect of \u0026ldquo;I got you, Seth\u0026rdquo;. But as Ben catches and throws, Seth has not slowed down, never thought about marking Ben. He just runs after the throw itself, which he blocks from behind. Now, I don\u0026rsquo;t know if Ben and Seth are buddies, and maybe you think what Ben said was \u0026ldquo;not spirited,\u0026rdquo; but it led to one of the best blocks I have ever seen, and no one was smiling more after the block than Ben himself. If we are enjoying ourselves, and smiling the way he was after that play, we are playing with spirit.\n"

  "content": "Really, honestly, how can anyone possibly not believe that this is a worthy philosophy to embrace? The only thing that kills me is the the name: \u0026ldquo;Spirit of the Game.\u0026rdquo; The word spirit is not synomynous with common words and expressions I associate with sports: Grit - Battle - Fair - Integrity - Determination - Motivation - Guts - Glory - Respect. \u0026ldquo;Spirit\u0026rdquo; is a word that I would associate with yoga class, folklore, or a Bible Group. It is not a bad word, just the wrong word for this particular audience.\nThe definition of SOG plays a relatively large role for me. When I first started playing this game, I thought it was ridiculous. I thought playing games without officials was silly and I thought it took away from the quality of the sport. Now, after years of careful observation and experiences as a player, captain, coach, and administrator, I think it is what could be our ticket to the next level. It could be our ticket to the next level because it could be the ticket to the next level in the youth division. Youth Ultimate is the key to the growth of our sport and if you can get that to grow, Ultimate will grow at all levels.\nSpirit of the Game, and what it stands for, what it really, really means, can be a huge selling point when presenting this sport to those you want to buy in. It teaches kids to place respect and fairness first. It teaches them conflict resolution. That is huge. I was blown away by the premise of Ultimate Peace (the foundation that led the charge to teach kids in the Middle East Ultimate frisbee in hopes to teach SotG and conflict resolution). I mean, if we could all be a little bit better at conflict resolution, how much better of a world would we be living in?? If you knew you would not get caught, or not be penalized, would you still steal? Ultimate not only reveals character, but builds it. A sport that builds character. How great is that?\nTherefore it means a lot to me. I am the President of the Triangle Youth Ultimate League and the coach of the UNC-Ch Women\u0026rsquo;s Ultimate frisbee team. My character, whether playing for Backhoe or coaching, or playing at winter league, is on display at all times and I want to represent well. I participate in this sport on many levels and I want to do so with a sense of pride. And, if no one is looking, I would still want to act within the definition of SotG, because it is the right thing to do.\nBut, that does not mean I am not human. I will make mistakes. I will lose my cool. It isn\u0026rsquo;t so much about me having these fallacies but my ability to reflect on them and make myself a better player, a better person by learning from my mistakes.\nWhat does it mean for my team? I would like to think that we play fair and we play within the rules. I would like to think we respect the definition of spirit of the game and conduct ourselves accordingly. We do not condone taunting, we do not condone bad calls. We will tell a player on our team to shut it if necessary. We will tell a player on our team that they were out, or it was down, or it was a foul, or it was not a foul - even it does not have our best interests in mind (best interests = winning). Why? Because we want to win a game outright because we were the better team within the rules of the game. We won (or lost) fair and square. No excuses.\nWhy would you want to win any other way besides playing completely within the rules of the game? And, win with grace, respect, and honor? So, you win a big game and act like an ass to the other team. Do you really feel good about yourself? Win with grace. Win with honor. Even if the opponent was a jerk to you. The Golden Rule\u0026quot;: Treat others as you would like to be treated. How can you possibly argue against that philosophy? The challenge is to do that when the other person is treating you really badly or cheating you.\nHow do you prepare for an opponent that might not make calls in good faith? Ask for observers. Forewarn them of the behavior. Go get observers. Keep your cool. Never, ever lower yourself to their level. Play with integrity.\nA teammate that may do the same: First of all , an apology can go a long way. Even if it is after the game. Even if it is not from that player, but just from you on behalf of your team. Second of all, control your teammates. Stand up for something that is bigger than any individual on your team, including yourself. Do it because it is the right thing to do. Even if no one is watching.\n"

I thank you for letting me write from my perspective without, I think, giving people the wrong impression about my team. But I think it is important that you get all sides here.\nI cheated in a game-to-go. When I made the call I thought it was correct but I knew right then about ten seconds later that it was wrong. But I stuck with it, and it mattered, and we won to go to UPAs. The other team, who I have played against many times, did not get to go as well. They were eliminated in the tournament though not in that game.\nI did feel and do feel honestly bad about it. I think that the other team made a bad call or two in the game, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t trying to even it out. I don\u0026rsquo;t even really care that it would have been my turnover either cause I\u0026rsquo;ve thrown turnovers before and they don\u0026rsquo;t get to me. Wanting to win was the major reason. Wanting my teammates to win was a second reason that was maybe bigger even than the first reason.\nWe had a great time at Nationals, and as this was my last year playing with some longtime teammates I am really, truly happy that I had that time to share with them. Of course this means that someone on some other team didn\u0026rsquo;t get it, but I did and it was a great tournament even if we didn\u0026rsquo;t do as well as we wanted to do. I thought about that call during the tournament, but just once and it wasn\u0026rsquo;t too bad.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not trying to say that your bad call will haunt you for the rest of your life or anything, cause maybe it will and maybe it won\u0026rsquo;t. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what it is like for me, I\u0026rsquo;m not that old yet. I just know that that one time that it was worth it and if I had to go back and do it over, knowing what I know now, I am not a hundred percent sure that I would change it. I bet most of my teammates would, but they and I don\u0026rsquo;t get that chance or want it. Bad calls get made all of the time in other sports, and sometimes they change who gets the spoils and sometimes they don\u0026rsquo;t matter. This time that bad call was me. I will say that I try not to make bad calls now, probably more than I did before that one and having to think about it.\nI think my teammates would feel bad right now if they knew this was me, but I think they were really happy to go to the championships then. That\u0026rsquo;s the problem.\n"

  "content": "No one gets four strikes in baseball simply because they think its wrong that the rules allow only three. You don\u0026rsquo;t pick and choose which rules to follow. You play by the rules of the game. Whether or not you agree with it, the Spirit of the Game concept is a fixture in the official rules of Ultimate so we, as players, have an obligation to adhere to it. But in the middle of a game, especially one with much at stake, what does it mean to adhere to a concept that is so vaguely defined?\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve all heard cheers of \u0026ldquo;good spirit\u0026rdquo; raised by opposing sidelines when a teammate concedes a contested play. But yielding to an opponent\u0026rsquo;s opinion cannot be what the rules mean by Spirit of the Game. Instead, the core of the Spirit of the Game concept is a mandate to play with integrity. Playing with integrity means playing as honestly and as objectively as possible. But it also requires the courage to stand by your honest opinion.\nTo me, Spirit of the Game means calling it the way you see it. It means not yielding to an opponent when your honest perspective differs. On the flip side, it means not allowing a vocal teammate to influence your perspective. And perhaps most difficult, it means not allowing the fact that your decision may determine the outcome of the entire game to influence your perspective.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s true that Spirit of the Game is often abused and disregarded. I have just two comments on those that play that way. First, disregarding Spirit of the Game is cheating, plain and simple. There is no faster way for a player to lose my respect than to disregard Spirit of the Game by knowingly making false calls to gain a competitive advantage. Second, any victories achieved without upholding Spirit of the Game are hollow victories. We commit hours and hours of time and energy all year long to compete on the field to determine the better team. All that effort is for naught when one gains a competitive advantage by cheating instead of by putting in hours on the track and at practice.\n"

Our D doesn\u0026rsquo;t have their legs under them yet. Our O is 5 for 5; while our D has had their hands on the disc 4 times and come up empty each time. The only untoward behavior so far has been from their hot shot college handler, let\u0026rsquo;s call him Bunny, who has called not one, but three fouls on high stall counts where, with no one cutting break, he\u0026rsquo;s pivoted into the marker and called foul; and one of our players, we\u0026rsquo;ll call him Big Harold, called foul on what\u0026rsquo;s usually a routine catch. The reception would have given us our first break, but instead his foul was contested and sent back and what followed was a miscue on the first pass. Now at 5 even, our D has the disc again. On a strong under cut, Taylor gets his hands under a dying disc just before it hits the ground. \u0026ldquo;DOWN!\u0026rdquo; cry everyone wearing black. \u0026ldquo;F-ing Up!\u0026rdquo; cry everyone wearing white.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not down cause you\u0026rsquo;re wearing white and I\u0026rsquo;m wearing black,\u0026rdquo; explains one of them. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s down, because it\u0026rsquo;s down.\u0026rdquo; Next I\u0026rsquo;m waiting for them to say \u0026ldquo;We gave you the last one,\u0026rdquo; which outside of the pre-game gift and Spirit speech (non-fiction: at Chicago Tune-up in 2002 the Warriors were given a gift and Spirit speech from Jack-Leg (because we\u0026rsquo;ve heard about you, they said), and suddenly we\u0026rsquo;re down 5-9 before going 1-3-3 and prevailing 13-11), is one of the lamest and unspirited things you can say or do.\n\u0026ldquo;You have to tell him it\u0026rsquo;s down,\u0026rdquo; says Jr., the guy defending me. \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s no way you can call that up—you saw it—you tell him it\u0026rsquo;s down.\u0026rdquo; And it\u0026rsquo;s that exact moment where the premise of the sport fails. Taylor standing there calling the disc up; who weeks ago running 120s was puking after 4 and could barely get through 10; and Big Harold there insisting that the disc is up and not backing down because his will to win is as great as their\u0026rsquo;s, unable to get more than 20 second rest on his 120s, and cramping all the way. Yeah, like I\u0026rsquo;m going to turn on them.\nMake yourself comfortable being uncomfortable they say. Don\u0026rsquo;t give as you got, they also say. But what happens when what you have been training and conditioning and practicing for suddenly becomes something else, something entirely different. Ideally, we\u0026rsquo;d like to think our preparation will allow us to develop enough self-control to perform reasonably under a variety of stress producing situations; but more often than not controlling one\u0026rsquo;s self becomes impossible and the burden on the player is possibly too great.\nNever mind the comparison to basketball, soccer, and football. Excluding the 3 pillars of baseball, Ultimate is most like and is meant to be most like what takes place within cycling\u0026rsquo;s peloton: rivals working together to maintain a code of etiquette and level of integrity. And as everyone knows, we get \u0026ldquo;platoon\u0026rdquo; from \u0026ldquo;peloton\u0026rdquo;. Here\u0026rsquo;s Bunny standing alongside captain Barnes. \u0026ldquo;We gave you the last one,\u0026rdquo; says Bunny. And on this side, shoulder to shoulder with Big Harold and Taylor, we\u0026rsquo;ve got Elias, captain of the white squad. \u0026ldquo;Stick with your call, kid,\u0026rdquo; says Elias. Something has to give.\nAnd so the disc goes back to the thrower.\n\u0026ldquo;Fugazi,\u0026rdquo; says Barnes.\n"

Respect for your opponent, respect for the situation, and respect for right to play this game at any level you want.\nEvery elite team must first slog their way through some pretty easy games on the road to Nationals.

Chill, let it go, be a nice person. But wait, \u0026ldquo;Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t you make a point to teach the inexperienced the correct way to play the game, thereby holding him to the strict interpretation of the 11th edition.\u0026rdquo; Answer: No. Let somebody else be that guy. And I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you, that guy is out there just frothing at the chance to show someone his rules prowess. You, instead, be the cool guy who wins like you were born to.\nChange the setting to any game at nationals and you get a different picture. The stakes are higher and so is the parity. Oh, and everybody at Nationals should know the rules. Plus there are observers. Here rules are enforced to the letter and everybody mostly agrees that to be okay and Spirited. Where Spirit plays out here is in a respect for the situation. Everybody is playing for that title. For most on the Elite teams, it can be pointed to as the most important thing. That said, things get heated at Nationals.\nI get heated at Nationals. I yell and curse and bitch and foul and spike and taunt and if need be go down swinging at Nationals. I play physical, I initiate contact and I will probably foul you once or twice in doing so. Let me know it bothers you? I\u0026rsquo;ll do it even more, cause I am trying to win just like you. I promise I\u0026rsquo;m not trying to hurt you. I love you. It\u0026rsquo;s just part of the game, just like penalties and fouls in any other sport. You want that to change? Change the rules. You may think that I have less respect for you, but it is quite the contrary: it means I must play that way because you deserve to experience the game the way it was meant to be played.\nI will also say this, I am not alone. There is no team at Nationals that doesn\u0026rsquo;t play physical defense, if there is I would ask how many bids their Region must have got. But I will tell you this, win or lose, I will respect my opponent who shared the field of battle with me. If you beat me, I hope I made it worth your while. My Spirit is my soul, and Ultimate is one of those few places where you can channel all that primal instinct and rage into something beautiful, something that only those on the field with you can understand. The sweat and blood and anger and passion is spread out on the field where it was laid for all to witness. You can go around collecting it up, and holding it, like the hate for that girl who dumped you and went out with your roommate, or you can leave it there and have a beer with me.\n"

  "content": "What if the Minnesota Timerwolves had to play Macalaster College and a YWCA pick-up team on their road to an NBA Championship? What if the Commissioner of MLB also governed little league and summer softball league? Those levels of play differ so much they are hardly the same sport. Yet in the Club Series of Ultimate, players from all levels comingle on the same field. The best players in the world compete against absolute novices. It is all governed by a single organization, and usually only a skeleton crew of volunteers oversees the proceedings. This creates community and growth, but also creates tension. We use the term \u0026ldquo;Spirit\u0026rdquo; to negotiate the tensions that result.\nMost disputes over Spirit are not about cheating. Overt, systematic cheating is so uncommon that it is shocking when it happens. Most games don\u0026rsquo;t need observers. Most Spirit debates involve different cultures of play mixing in the tournament setting. Some people play Ultimate primarily for the camaraderie; others would switch teams in a flash if they thought it would get them more wins. To each the other seems to have no clue what Spirit means. Some teams uphold meticulous pivot foot standards and blow off incidental contact; other teams pay no attention to travels but expect a truly noncontact game. These teams seem to have no respect for each other\u0026rsquo;s Spirit. College teams often bring a level of sideline psyche that feels taunting and aggressive towards their opponents, but is part of high level college gamesmanship. When a high school team brings that energy it seems unspirited and cruel.\nJuniors, College, Club, Masters, Mixed, Open, Women\u0026rsquo;s. Each level involves players with different physical and emotional maturity, different experience levels, different life circumstances, and different reasons for playing. Put them all in a blender called the UPA and hit puree. Sometimes ugly, sometimes frustrating, the tension that results is discussed using the language of Spirit.\n"

  "content": "I love the Huddle. I think the work they do is a great contribution to Ultimate, I love reading the other contributors\u0026rsquo; work and I am honored that they would include me as an author. That said, I can\u0026rsquo;t believe they are making such a colossal mistake in having ONE Spirit of the Game issue.\nSpirit of the Game is essential to Ultimate. Every time we step on the field to play, we are participating in what makes Ultimate unique and special. If you know me, you know I\u0026rsquo;m not a hand-holding, let\u0026rsquo;s-all-love-each-other player. But you are an idiot if you think that Spirit doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter, however you choose interpret it. To dedicate a single issue to Spirit of the Game is like having an issue entitled \u0026ldquo;Offense: Discuss\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Defense: How do you do it?\u0026rdquo;\nRather than answer their question about Spirit, I\u0026rsquo;m going to lay out the issues Ben and Andy should have arranged.\n1. Does Spirit of the Game work? Lots of people think it doesn\u0026rsquo;t and they have their reasons. Lots of people think it does and they have their reasons. This is the fundamental question and a natural beginning.\n2. How will Spirit of the Game affect the future of Ultimate? rec.sport.disc has a lot of opinions about this one, but it\u0026rsquo;d be nice to hear from someone with a brain.\n3. What is the call game? The concept of a call game (and gamesmanship in general) is an essential one to understanding Ultimate, but too many players don\u0026rsquo;t even have the words in their vocabulary. A primer on fundamental aspects of Ultimate is something The Huddle does well, so it\u0026rsquo;s shocking they haven\u0026rsquo;t included this one.\n4. What\u0026rsquo;s your best call game move? We all know about stepping into the mark on stalling 8 to draw the foul, but what about all those subtle sneaky moves club players use? Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t you like them to share those little tricks (and how to stop them?) This issue should probably be anonymous.\n5. Should you use the call game? Beyond what it is (Spirit Issue 3) and how to do it (Spirit Issue 4) stands the ethical question: should you use it? I had a couple older guys take me aside and give me some advice I should have headed (thank you Will Healey and Gary Brady) but that I ignored. All the young players out there should have an equal opportunity to ignore good advice.\n6. Great mistakes you\u0026rsquo;ve made. Everyone has calls they wish they could have back. This is the chance to put them down on paper and get some much needed expiation. I have a hard time imagining anyone stepping up to write this one, but if they did, it\u0026rsquo;d be great reading.\n7. How would you \u0026lsquo;fix\u0026rsquo; Spirit of the Game? We all have our little pet projects and ideas on how to improve Ultimate. I\u0026rsquo;d be interested in hearing how people want to adjust the core principle of our little game.\n8. Refs or observers or nothing? Give everyone a chance to weigh in on this rec.sport.disc classic.\n9. Which article would you recommend and why? I always want a chance to rebut or amend or just comment on what the other authors have written. Given the importance of Spirit, a rare The Huddle opportunity to reflect on the other contributors\u0026rsquo; writing would be a pleasant way to wrap things up.\nThere you go. Nine issues and probably not enough.\nAs always, you can contact me at louburruss@gmail.com.\n"

  "issue": "024",
  "content": "To me, Spirit of the Game has two principal components: respect (don\u0026rsquo;t be an ass) and integrity (don\u0026rsquo;t be a cheater). I think you could go through reams of paper defining how those two principles should and do play out, which is not my intent here.\nMy point is that playing with Spirit is much harder than I think we give it credit for. What we are asking of people is to fight against their ego, their desire for appreciation and status. These are basic human desires—humans compete for them in all sorts of arenas (money, popularity, who can hook up with the most attractive member of the opposite sex, and, of course, sport). I believe it\u0026rsquo;s possible and worthwhile to attempt to overcome those desires, but it\u0026rsquo;s a much more arduous process than just deciding to do so.\nAs a player, I\u0026rsquo;m probably worse than most in the Spirit category. When I lose my temper, I\u0026rsquo;m prone to make bad calls, treat the rules as guidelines, or raise my voice in argument. I\u0026rsquo;m not proud of this behavior.\nAt the same time, I value the challenge. It\u0026rsquo;s an opportunity to get to know the demons that lurk inside of us, and, with hard work, allows us to get rid of one or two. I value a sport that asks its athletes to take on this challenge.\n"

  "title": "What Goes Through Your Head",
  "author": "Ben van Heuvelen",
  "issue": "024",
  "content": "Last year at Northeast Regionals my team (PoNY) was playing Bodhi to go to Nationals. Game tied at 12s, time cap approaching, PoNY is on defense. Bodhi goes on a fast break with a quick succession of give-go throws—\u0026ldquo;Pick!\u0026rdquo; someone yells—and the last throw, a huck, falls incomplete. The two teams start to argue. Was the pick two throws ago, or one? Does the disc go back to Bodhi, or is it a turnover? The outcome of the game might turn on this call. The teams immediately appeal to the observer, who rules that the pick was two throws ago: Bodhi\u0026rsquo;s disc. Then Russell Wallack, one of Bodhi\u0026rsquo;s handlers, jogs over and enters the discussion. \u0026ldquo;I was right behind the play and saw the whole thing. The pick happened on the last throw. It\u0026rsquo;s PoNY\u0026rsquo;s disc.\u0026rdquo; The observer had just ruled in his team\u0026rsquo;s favor, but Russell effectively overturns the call. His teammates look at him in disbelief as PoNY takes possession. Then they get a D and earn their goal.\nPlayers like Russell have taught me that, all other definitions aside, the Spirit of the Game means two things: self-respect and mental toughness.\nThe best players treat competition as an opportunity for them to measure their greatness. Imagine a set of scales: you and your team are on one end, your opponents on the other. The fulcrum is made of the rules of the game. If you break the rules, you unbalance the scales and lose the accuracy of the measurement. If you belittle your opponents, you lose your counterweight, and diminish the meaning of any success you might have. (Your win doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean very much if \u0026ldquo;they suck.\u0026rdquo;) In order to evaluate yourself and your team honestly—that is, to have self-respect—you have to treat your opponents and the rules with respect, and even gratitude. Without them, you can\u0026rsquo;t measure your greatness.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know if this thought, or anything like it, was going through Russell\u0026rsquo;s head when he reversed that observer\u0026rsquo;s call. But I can tell you that Russell is one of the most consistent and mentally tough players I\u0026rsquo;ve encountered—and I\u0026rsquo;m convinced sportsmanship is a big piece of his success. Speaking from my own experience, I\u0026rsquo;ve always played my best when my concern for winning has evaporated in the heat of my competitive effort. We all care about the result of the game, but if I let myself focus on who\u0026rsquo;s going to score more points, or how I\u0026rsquo;m going to look on UltiVillage, or how big a jerk my opponent is and how much he deserves to lose, I\u0026rsquo;m just distracting myself from the next cut, the next throw, the next D. If, on the other hand, I give all of my energy to the intensity of my effort, I\u0026rsquo;m a better player. The less I focus on winning, the better my chances of winning are.\nSuch an attitude also improves the way I respond to adversity. If I think of my opponent as an opportunity to test my greatness, then the better he plays, the more psyched I get. His great play is nothing but a challenge for me to push my game higher. If, on the other hand, all I want out of competition is a \u0026ldquo;W\u0026rdquo; on the board, then my opponent\u0026rsquo;s sweet layout grab feels like terrible misfortune. Did you see the look on Kurt Warner\u0026rsquo;s face when the Steelers scored their go-ahead touchdown in last year\u0026rsquo;s Superbowl? There was more than a minute left on the clock, but you knew the game was over. Poor Kurt would have preferred the Steelers hand him the game than really make him earn it.\nI could read that look on Kurt Warner\u0026rsquo;s face because I\u0026rsquo;ve worn that look, too. I fail the sportsman\u0026rsquo;s test all the time. It\u0026rsquo;s usually the inspiration of other players—the example of opponents like Russell; the example I want to set for my teammates—that helps me achieve greatness, if I do.\nOne of my prouder moments on an ultimate field happened early last season. Ironside is coming down on the pull, with Colin Mahoney sprinting down to cover me. The disc swings from the catch to the hitch, and I jog a lazy cut out into the lane. The throw goes up, and my hands are almost closed on it, when Colin dives and yanks it away. I call \u0026ldquo;Strip!\u0026rdquo; Colin pounds the ground, jumps up—he\u0026rsquo;s about to scream, eyes bugging out of his head, mouth open in disbelief. He knows he just got a D. He takes a breath. \u0026ldquo;BVH, I got that.\u0026rdquo; I take a breath. \u0026ldquo;Really?\u0026rdquo; Colin points to the disc, which is in his hand, not mine.\nI\u0026rsquo;m still not 100% sure what the right call was, but here was my thought process:\n0 seconds after the play: \u0026ldquo;Definitely a strip. I\u0026rsquo;m a beast of a receiver. I never get D\u0026rsquo;ed. Only possible explanation for me not catching a disc is a foul or a strip.\u0026rdquo;\n5 seconds: \u0026ldquo;Colin\u0026rsquo;s a pretty honest guy. He looks really convinced. Is it possible his hand was on the disc first? Is it possible I didn\u0026rsquo;t stop the rotation?\u0026rdquo;\n10 seconds: \u0026ldquo;That play shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been close. If I bail out my half- assed effort now with an iffy call, then I\u0026rsquo;m letting myself develop bad habits.\u0026rdquo;\n15 seconds: \u0026ldquo;But don\u0026rsquo;t I owe it to my teammates to uphold my call if there\u0026rsquo;s any chance it was a strip?\u0026rdquo;\n20 seconds: \u0026ldquo;People make bad calls when they\u0026rsquo;re afraid, good calls when they\u0026rsquo;re confident. What message do I want to send my team?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ok, Colin. I trust you. No strip.\u0026rdquo;\nTwo months later, we were playing again, and this time I got a layout D on Colin. Colin calls \u0026ldquo;Strip!\u0026rdquo; I say, \u0026ldquo;Really?\u0026rdquo; Pause. \u0026ldquo;Ok, BVH. No strip.\u0026rdquo;\n"

  "author": "Ben Wiggins",
  "issue": "024",
  "content": "I\u0026rsquo;ll let better writers and players describe why Spirit is, or is not, worth your time. I know my answer, and you have to find your own.\nIf you come away having decided that it is worth your your effort, here are a couple of things that your team can do to improve your own Spirit on the field in meaningful games. At the very least, they are things that my teams have done in the past that have helped.\n1. Team Calls\nOne player can make a bad call in the heat of the moment. It is easier for a team to be objective. Make calls a team responsibility.\nOne way you can do this is to have a secret signal that your team uses. After a call, this signal tells the player involved in the call that you have an opinion. It does not give away what you think about that call, only that you have feedback if the caller wants it.\nThis allows your teammate to check in with you, even if you are off the field. You can then tell them that they are absolutely correct, or you can calmly (and privately) tell them that you had a good look at it, and that this call should go the other team\u0026rsquo;s way. The final onus is on the caller, who doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to accept feedback; but most will if they have a question. Instilling this as a team philosophy makes everyone responsible, and it makes it easier for a heated player to make the right decision.\nNote: This will not endear you to teams that cannot deal with any delay. It takes some time to communicate, even non-verbally, and in the past I feel like some of my team\u0026rsquo;s bad calls have been perceived as cheating, and then the caller comes to their senses while our opponent yells a bunch. The reality is that we are discussing the call as a team, and your yelling is just getting in the way of us making sure our call was correct, or giving it up.\n2. Be Consistent between Points\nIf you would call a travel on game-point against team X, call it at 1-1 the same as at 14-14. Surprisingly often this will force your opponents to stop traveling, and you won\u0026rsquo;t need to call it again later. If they do, then you have a stupid opponent who either has no regard for their footwork, or they have been negligent in practicing their fundamentals. Either way, it is on them, and they should have known better than throwing the same lazy sliding huck on game point.\nNote: This will not endear you to the crowd. Screw the crowd. The crowd is made up of very smart people, in most cases. But the crowd is stupid.\n3. Be Consistent between Sides\nSplitting a team between O- and D-teams is bad for Spirit. In the \u0026lsquo;old\u0026rsquo; days, more players played both ways, so you would matchup with the same player, and you would have feedback on how each other marked and threw and played. If my opponent called a foul on my mark, I could guage that against his mark on me. Now, I generally see a dozen marks from the same defender per game, and unless our offense is struggling, I may only mark him 1-2 times in that entire game. Since we don\u0026rsquo;t get the same person-to-person feedback as if we were playing every point (guarding each other roughly every-other point) it is more difficult to come to a clear consensus on where the line stands.\nWe ask our O-team to try to call fewer fouls, so that the other team has to accept our physical defense. We ask our defenders to try to commit fewer fouls, so that our O-team doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to accept a barrage of hacking marks throughout the game.\n4. Make Calls in Practice/ Practice Making Calls\nIf your team scrimmages in practice like it is life-or-death, then you will be more ready for the high-pressure environment and high-pressure calls of big games. Honestly, though, if your team doesn\u0026rsquo;t already scrimmage full speed and full anatagonism against each other then you have bigger problems. Raising the stakes at practice, and making calls on each other in practice, will help.\n5. Kill the \u0026lsquo;Auto-BS\u0026rsquo; Response\nIf you want your opponents to play with more Spirit, give them the opportunity. Assume that they will make the correct call\u0026hellip;and if you can\u0026rsquo;t do that, then fake it. Give them an opportunity to take their call back without screaming in their face. Let them take back their call without losing face or making it seem like they were backing down to your volume.\nHeck, screaming at your opponent is the only way I know to insure that you will not win that call. Everyone has seen a charged-up sideline explode after a call (sometimes even the first call of the game). Explain to your teammates that this is probably losing you calls, and hence losing points, throughout a tournament. Then see if the catharsis they get from yelling at the enemy is really worth it.\n6. A Rules Quiz for your Team\nWrite a rules quiz, and give it to your team. You don\u0026rsquo;t even need to demand that they take the quiz. Just suggest it. If you have teammates that make sketchy calls, or think they know the rules much better than they do, this can be a non-confrontational way to demonstrate their lack of knowledge.\nAt the very least, more people on your team will read the rules again.\nAt best, people on your team will start to defer to (or ask for explanations from) those people on your team that know the rules well. Hopefully, this results in fewer calls from players that really don\u0026rsquo;t know the rules.\nNote: Personally, I would love to see a Rules Quiz given to players at high- level, even if just to help illustrate the rules and force players to check in with the rules once per year. The UPA does this with Coordinators: there is an online quiz that isn\u0026rsquo;t hard, but it is a great reminder. Why can\u0026rsquo;t we do this with players? I could have this ready in 3 days using SurveyMonkey. We wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even need to require a passing score; just require that the quiz is taken and make the results public. Open book, even. Trust me, this will help.\nConclusion: This is far from an exhaustive list of the things that you could do to help your team\u0026rsquo;s Spirit. But these all work, and now that you know some options that could work for you, the question comes back: Is Spirit worth the effort?\nADDENDUM: There are a few existing rules tests online. A test based on the UPA rules can be found at: http://www.ultipedia.org/wiki/UPA_Rules_Quiz/.\n"

  "title": "Avoid The Pile-Up",
  "author": "Ray Illian",
  "issue": "023",
  "content": "We\u0026rsquo;ve all been there before. The throw goes up, the disc catches some wind, and just hangs. As the intended offensive receiver, you are forced to slow down and track the path of the disc. It soon becomes quite crowded around you as multiple players converge on what seems like the optimal position to vie for the disc. Soon it\u0026rsquo;s time to jump for the disc and hope everything works out. If you can maneuver through the tangled mess of limbs and actually extend your arm(s) into the air unfettered and catch the disc, then pat yourself on the back. You completed a low percentage catch, and the thrower owes you a burrito/sandwich at the next team dinner.\nFor the rest of us who aren\u0026rsquo;t Alex Nord or Brodie Smith, our best chances of catching the disc arise from exploiting the weaknesses of the pile-up. The first of which is a speed mismatch. Crowds of people vying for the same position are usually moving pretty slow. Take advantage of this and always be moving faster than the crowd when you prepare to jump for the disc. Sprint towards the pile, take the extra long step to lower your center of gravity (and load your calves like a spring), and use the extra space around you to translate your horizontal momentum into vertical momentum by propelling your off-jumping leg and catching arm upwards in one motion. This could very well give you the extra inch or two you need to sky the pile, as those trapped in the pile are usually unable to jump at their maximum height.\nAnother weakness for those in the pile-up is perspective. The farther away you are from the crowd, the better your grasp of the situation becomes: You have a more complete view of the path of the disc and the movement of other players which gives you a better idea of where the disc will end up. This information can help you take the best course of action, whether it\u0026rsquo;s trying to sky the pile, realizing the pile has the wrong read on the disc and beating them to the right spot unobstructed, or strategically positioning yourself to pick up the trash after a deflection (which is more likely than the disc being caught).\nTruth be told, the intended receiver rarely is the one to win these 50/50 type scenarios. Rather, it\u0026rsquo;s the heads-up offensive player on the other end of the field—surveying the situation and acting accordingly at 100% - who is going to come down with the disc. Avoid the pile-up.\n"

  "author": "Brett Matzuka",
  "issue": "023",
  "content": "Usually being the shortest guy on the teams I play on, catching 50/50 (jump ball) discs from my perspective is a different game altogether. There are two situations you can encounter with a 50/50 disc. Either you are in the eye of the storm, in which case you were the initial receiver or your the first defender to get into the play, and a multitude of others are collapsing down upon you from all places.\nThis case is the hard one for people of my stature as you will get caught up in a group of people obviously taller than you. In this case, there are a few steps you can take to maximize your chances of getting a play on the disc.\nThe two most important parts to me can be summed up with: play smart, play tall.\nPlay smart just means don\u0026rsquo;t try and out jump or play a game of 500 with a group of people who already have a huge advantage in height. Instead of attempting to sky Shaq, try and get to the position where you believe the disc will first be playable. This is especially important as most packs of people are rarely in the spot the disc will first be playable, but will stumble there as the disc floats by. This is your chance to take advantage of all those trying to battle for immediate position on one another to get a good chance to get into position for the disc. Getting in position for the disc is defined as getting to the point which maximizes your personal chance of making a play on the disc, while getting position on an opponent is defined as getting in a position to minimize your opponents chance of making a play on the disc.\nDefensively, this second definition is important since for someone short like myself, you can lure your opposition out of his best position to make a play on the disc to a less advantageous position; this may not immediately benefit you in terms of making a play yourself, but it does cut their chances of receiving the pass which is realistically your real objective on defense. For our sake, we will be trying to catch the disc at all times. With that, once you have got to a position you believe is best for you to play the disc, next it is time to play tall.\nFor someone like me, this means one simple thing: Go up early! Like I said before, you are not going to sky Shaq, but you can catch him off guard before he begins to make a play. If you go up early, not just will that give you a better chance, but it also will increase your chances of getting fouled. A taller guy thinks he can take another second to set up as he already has the height advantage. By going up early, you have already established your position in the air. If the opponent then jumps later and into you, there is a decent chance his contact will result in a foul which results in your possession. Since this is your overall goal, taking any advantage to accomplish it is worthwhile.\nThe second case that comes up is the group has already formed and you are running in to join the pack. In this case, being my height, it isn\u0026rsquo;t about joining the giants as much as predicting the final outcome. Most likely, the disc will get mac\u0026rsquo;d (mac = mid air correction) around, and your job is to predict where it is to finally finish its flight. This is more advantageous than joining the pack because 1. you will probably not be able to follow the steps from case one which is probably your only chance of realistically having a play, 2. because jumping from outside the pack into it almost always results in a foul whether you accept it or not, and 3. the best outcome personally from your position is being the scrapper.\nSo, for this second case, instead of joining the mayhem, read the disc flight pattern, the wind, the group and try and place yourself outside the pack in a place the disc most likely will finish if no one explicitly catches it. This sounds easy enough, and it is, but you will be surprised at how many times a few players join a pack with no realistic shot at receiving the disc just to watch as it gets mac\u0026rsquo;d to where they were before they decided to jump in. If you watched Rhino\u0026rsquo;s highlight videos from Regionals 2 years ago, they got 3-4 completions/goals by having players stand outside the pack and make plays on the scraps after large numbers of big men mac\u0026rsquo;d it.\nAll in all, when the disc goes up and you think you can make a play, whether you are the intended receiver or the dump for that throw that jump went up, put everything you can into making it a completion. Whether it is a complete jump ball, or a one on one contest, if you play smart and play tall, you will surely come down with more discs than before.\n"

  "author": "Lindsey Hack",
  "issue": "023",
  "content": "In order to catch a 50/50 disc a player needs to be able to do a number of things correctly to win the battle.\n1. Reading\nThe player must be able to read the disc and understand how the wind and the way the disc was thrown is going to affect its flight path.\n2. Positioning\nOnce that player has a good grasp of where that disc is going to float down to earth, that player must establish that position firmly. This, establishing and maintaining your position, does take strength, and if a player thinks that they can continue to compete at high levels without weight training, they are out of their minds.\n3. Jump\nThe player must be able to jump higher than the other people in this group who are also trying to do #1 and #2. If you do number one and number two perfectly, but do not have as high of a vertical as someone else in this cluster, there is still a chance you will come down with that disc. If you want to ensure that it is you that is going to catch that disc, get yourself on a plyometric program and increase your vertical. With jumping also comes timing your jump. Timing your jump is also a skill that can be worked on. Every time you go tossing, practice timing your catch with reaching the peak of your vertical. he more you are able to catch discs at the peak of your vertical in practice, the more likely you will be able to do this in a game situation. This takes timing and knowing when the disc is at the right height for you.\n4. Catching The Disc\nYou have read the disc right, you got the position, you can jump higher than anyone else, and you have perfect timing on your jump. Now, catch that piece of plastic! Snatch it out of the air! Grab it! Do not gently try to pull it out of the air. Catch with authority. Practice catching with one hand. Practice catching with your left. Practice catching with your right. Practice catching. Do not let yourself casually drop it even when tossing. Remember, perfect practice makes perfect.\n"

  "content": "Catching a 50/50 disc is not an exact science just like every other aspect of Ultimate and unfortunately there aren\u0026rsquo;t a lot of aspects you can practice if you\u0026rsquo;re looking to sky the best receivers in the game. Superior athleticism and your ability to read the disc almost always win. However, there are a few things (besides improving vertical leap, experience, etc.) that can set you apart from the rest of the pack if you want to have an advantage at catching a disc over someone of similar or greater ability.\nThe first thing may seem obvious but you won\u0026rsquo;t believe how many of the best receivers in the game have a preferred hand to catch with, and/or will always catch with the same hand in a big moment. As an elite receiver you should be 100% confident with either hand at any moment during the game.\nThe second is body position. As an offender on a 50/50 disc you need to be able to anticipate where the disc is going to be where you can catch it at your highest because you have to assume that with two or three other defenders on you, someone will be at least as good a jumper/reader as you are. As soon as the huck goes up you have to get yourself to where you can make a bid for the disc at the peak of your jump without letting the other defenders get position. You have to get to the spot where you will catch the disc at its peak regardless of where the defenders go around you. Don\u0026rsquo;t let the defense dictate where you can position yourself.\nThe last important aspect of catching a 50/50 disc is the drop step. Again, even many of the best receivers have a preference of which foot they jump off. It is very important to be able to drop step/jump off both feet. ou never know when you need to go off your right foot and catch with your left hand or vice versa to be at your highest point depending on where your defender(s) are.\nAn example where you can win a 50/50 using all of these skills. Let\u0026rsquo;s say you and two other defenders are all running underneath a moving disc and all of you are 5'10 and can catch a disc at 10ft in the air. The disc is hovering at 11 ft and as an offender you need to come down with this disc. The disc is bobbing up and down and is about to come into the 10ft range so everyone drop steps and prepares to jump, however, you and the other defender see as you do that that the disc bobs right back up. One defender goes up too early. That leaves you and one other defender. As soon as the defender missed the disc it starts to come back down close to the ten foot range. Because you can jump off both legs you only have to take three strides to drop step again and jump off your other foot. The defender has to take four strides and jump off the same foot. You jump first and go up with the hand opposite the leg you jumped off of and catch the disc because you can catch/jump confidently with both legs/feet. The first defender was only confident in jumping/catching off one foot/hand and he also gave up body position by jumping early. The second defender couldn\u0026rsquo;t jump off the other foot confidently leaving him one stride behind you despite maintaining position.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve just saved your team a turnover and possibly the game if you can catch with both hands confidently, jump of both feet confidently, and maintain establish position first.\n"

  "issue": "023",
  "content": "My first action, after recognizing that I am about to engage in a 50/50 disc tango, is to take the appropriate angle of attack based on where I think the disc is going to go. This is obviously stale information for veterans. But for the beginners out there, you\u0026rsquo;ll always be considered a member of the grounds crew if you keep running directly underneath the disc expecting that it will drop down to you. Being able to understand the disc\u0026rsquo;s angle of descent with ease will put you on the fast track to a Sky Club membership.\nThe next step for me is to try and visualize the best course of action I need to take to get the disc in my hand. I\u0026rsquo;ll have images running through my head that guide me through the upcoming attack. Do I see myself needing to shield off my defender(s)? Should I accelerate/decelerate to the disc? The goal for me is to be proactive about what I need to do instead of being reactive. During this process, the disc and its trajectory will hopefully position itself in in a way that looks familiar to what I have been preparing for.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve described this moment to teammates by saying the disc looks fatter to me. I have no logical explanation as to why the disc looks fatter. Maybe it will look like a cheeseburger to you if you try this, I don\u0026rsquo;t know. All I know is I have a visual trigger that tells me it\u0026rsquo;s time to execute.\nPersonally, the ability to visualize how to attack a floaty disc mid-flight comes from practice. I have practiced pulling down high discs hundreds of times (and counting) against a plethora of leapers in Austin and against my soccer player of a younger brother (always good for confidence building). In a game, I know I can take the time to relax and visualize while the disc is in the air because I am comfortable in this situation. I am confident of when to attack, because I have practiced it many times before.\nOne last thing I would like to add is that I think a common mistake in the 50/50 situation is to worry about how high your competitors can jump. If you freak yourself out about whom you are up against, you are setting yourself up for failure. Be confident in what you can do and let the other person(s) do the worrying.\n"

  "issue": "023",
  "content": "When it comes to catching a floating 50/50 disc, one of the most important things to think about is that if the other person is going to get the disc then at least make them make a play. Force them to make a great play to catch it, don\u0026rsquo;t let it be easy. This philosophy most directly applies to playing defence, but still applies to offensive situations.\nToo often I see players setting up position behind their opposition. As a shorter player going up against a taller player this is especially detrimental. As soon as you set up shop behind someone you are giving them the advantage. They now have the first shot at making the catch. You will only catch it if they jump and miss it. You\u0026rsquo;ve given them superior positioning and they won\u0026rsquo;t feel much pressure from your presence as they are in front with a clear line of sight to the disc and nothing in their way preventing them from making the catch.\nEstablishing inside position is the first step towards winning the sky battle. Again, if you are shorter than your opponent this is imperative. By establishing inside position you now have a chance to control the situation. You have a better opportunity to find the spot on the field where you can catch the disc at the peak of your jump. If you do this it means the player behind you (who might be taller) has to jump up and reach over you (forward) in order to catch the disc. This is a lot more challenging for them as they have to reach further out than originally desired, and mentally have to worry about you whilst at the same time trying to focus on catching the disc. If they\u0026rsquo;re four inches taller than you they may still catch the disc, but at least it was tougher than it would have been otherwise and you have made them make a play. However, it is possible you have given them too much to think about and they drop the disc or jump too early and miss it entirely.\nAgain, this strategy most directly applies to playing defence on 50/50 discs as when no one catches it you still win. However, this equally applies to offense as it is always easier to catch a disc when no one is in your way rather than having to jump over someone. Your opponent doesn\u0026rsquo;t know what kind of hops you have and getting inside position gives you that little bit of an advantage you need and gives your opponent a few more things to think about when calculating their attack.\nFor an analogy to other sports, try watching basketball players as they establish themselves to retrieve a rebound. They expel the majority of their effort getting to the right spot on the floor in front of everyone else. Once there the rebound is theirs following an easy jump.\n"

  "content": "While we call these hangers \u0026ldquo;50/50 discs,\u0026rdquo; I would bet that at the moment the disc is coming down an observer would have a better than coin-flip chance of guessing who will touch the disc first. Keying in on the information informing that decision will help guide a player in giving themselves a better than coin-flip chance of getting to it first.\nI think that beyond obvious physical differences (\u0026ldquo;I like the guy who is 6'8\u0026rdquo; over the short guy\u0026quot;) the two main components are positioning and approach. If you\u0026rsquo;re at the spot early you may want to position yourself so that someone else approaching on a dead run isn\u0026rsquo;t going to be able to have a clean takeoff and take it at their highest point. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you are not playing the disc, but it does mean that you are going to play the disc in a way that allows you to reduce your opponent\u0026rsquo;s chance of taking it at a higher point than you.\nRelated to this is the approach. If there are three people standing still under the disc and one guy is coming in with a clean running jump, I like the guy on the outside. This means that if you are going to be the third or fourth man in the pile, it might be better to hold up for a second and try to time it so you jump over the group. This is easier said than done, but we\u0026rsquo;ve all seen pictures of people getting roofed because they\u0026rsquo;re stuck standing still while another guy had a clean jumping approach.\n"

  "issue": "023",
  "content": "To catch a 50/50 disc, you need to somehow make the chances better than 50/50 for yourself. The first thing you can do is be tall—and yes, I know you can\u0026rsquo;t teach height, but this also includes putting your hand up outstretched and trying to catch the disc at your \u0026ldquo;tallest point\u0026rdquo; including your jump. This is related to the second thing which is timing your jump. I know lots of players (particularly new women) who think just putting their hand up will work—well, it won\u0026rsquo;t work against good competition. To know when to jump you need to practice jumping and catching as high as you possibly can—playing flyers- up/500 and doing lots of one on one catching will help with this.\nThe third, and possibly most important thing, is to get position on as many of the other people as you possibly can. If one of the other people is your teammate, getting position on the opponent can actually allow your teammate to catch the disc, too. If you can judge where the disc will come down and put your body between that space and your opponent, you will greatly increase your chances of catching the disc. However, you must, as I like to tell my players, \u0026ldquo;Retain that s***!\u0026rdquo; This means that once you get position, you can\u0026rsquo;t relax—you must actively maintain your position physically.\nADDENDUM:\nWe received this email from a reader:\nI read the article from Ms. Roth about the catching discs subject and I disagree with one point. Ms. Roth wrote: \u0026ldquo;If one of the other people is your teammate, getting position on the opponent can actually allow your teammate to catch the disc, too\u0026rdquo; For me, if you don\u0026rsquo;t play the disc you are not allowed to block the opponent to help your teammate. I checked WFDF Rules and it is related to rule 12.7. Keep up the good work. -a reader in France The Huddle\u0026rsquo;s Explanation:\nThanks, ARIF, We (and Miranda) agree with the rule that an offensive player cannot move solely to block a defender. For instance, if you are on defense, I can\u0026rsquo;t run towards you and away from my teammate just to make sure you cannot make a play. Miranda is trying to make the point that the offense is allowed to choose whatever method they want to make a play on the disc. If I am on offense, and I move in a way where I could catch the disc but also is a position that seals a defender from making a likely play, this can be both legal and extremely effective. In practical terms, the differences between an illegal block and a legal positioning is probably going to come down to whether the player in question could (given flight of the disc, position, and where the player is looking) make a catch on that particular throw. Thanks, ARIF, for bringing this confusing issue to more clarity and we hope this makes sense. -The Editors\n"

  "issue": "023",
  "content": "On Offense\nYou ought to have done much of the work up front. You were out in the lane first, making an open cut to the end zone, you were looking over your shoulder and saw the release point of the throw. You made your read early, calculated the trajectory of the disc, and picked your line before your defender even heard an up call.\nRealizing that your thrower has laid you out to dry with a floaty throw (at least they didn\u0026rsquo;t pump fake and make you come under), you pick a spot four to five yards from where the disc will come down between the disc and the defender to hold your ground. You pause, as several other defenders and Danny Trydiak pile up near you. As the disc is just about to glide into range you attack, with two large, powerful steps towards the spot you predicted and an inertia-aided spring from your dominant leg. You jump, and snatch the disc right over the top of the pile of defenders. People tangle up in your wake, Danny springs free for the end zone, and an easy throw for a goal.\nOn Defense\nYour head was down, you were running hard to make up ground, when the up call came. You immediately look up to see the disc, just a glance and a quick read—it is floating—and then you put your head back down and try to close the distance between you and your mark, knowing that they have already gotten a better look at the disc. As you close in, your mark starts to slow up a little, you glance over your shoulder again at the disc, this time able to make a fair judgment of where it is going to come down. Your mark ought to have picked the best spot to be in already, a few paces from the anticipated catch zone. You quickly do the math, \u0026ldquo;Am I taller/wider than my opponent? If so, I would get between them and the disc, forcing them to initiate contact on their jump, and effectively using my girth/height advantage to box them off the disc. No, I am shorter but jumpier.\u0026rdquo;\nYou pick a line similar to the offensive player, a few big steps laterally from the anticipated catch zone, and pause as more offensive players and Danny Trydiak pile up under the disc. At the right moment you spring, propelling yourself towards the disc and then up—your highest jump. At the last second, you remind yourself, \u0026ldquo;Be sure\u0026rdquo; and opt to catch the D instead of macking it. As players tangle and fall in your wake, you swing the disc wisely to Roger, knowing that Danny will probably just huck it\u0026hellip;.\n"

  "content": "When I play, I often pick up the disc after a turnover. When I coach, my teams are in this situation often (as Lou noted, college teams have dead-disc situations much more frequently than in club Ultimate). Given the inherent confusion of the moment, I value a simple communication system in order to create positive and coordinated disc movement in a chaotic environment.\nI really don\u0026rsquo;t care if everyone on the team can call plays. How many players are really going to be picking up the disc after a turnover anyway? 2-3 on your team, total? 4? What I do value, however, is a system where those few players can simply and clearly tell the rest of the team what they want to happen. As a coach, I like to be able to call out a sequence to beat a specific poach or matchup. I like running very few plays, but having an extra level of communication ready to describe individual moves.\nOne system I\u0026rsquo;ve used: Every player on the team is assigned a letter. Unless they are a play-caller, they really only need to remember that single letter (which is great for the majority of the team that is rarely going to be encoding the information). We then use either a number or a letter for 4-5 different kinds of cuts. 1 = deep, 2 = in, 3= break, etc. This means that I can walk to a disc, and see that the defense is planning an in-out bracket of two cutters. If those cutters are \u0026lsquo;R\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;S\u0026rsquo;. I can call R2 S3, telling both cutters to come underneath to different sides of the field. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter that neither cutter can see the bracket; they\u0026rsquo;ll give me bracket-beating options naturally.\nYou can cook this system up by adding in numbers for dump-swings, give-go moves, and continuation (for example, R2 S2 might be simultaneous cuts, but saying \u0026lsquo;\u0026lsquo;R3 and S1\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; could give me an open R cutting for a break throw and then looking for a huck to S.\nWhen I played basketball, my team ran 6-8 plays during the course of a game. Each play, however, gave me different options that I could use. If we had a nice size mismatch at small forward, there was a play that (even if not the first option) would send our SF into the post. Running a (relatively) simple system to give your on-field \u0026lsquo;point guards\u0026rsquo; (or at least your coach) these kind of flexible options might be worth your time.\nObviously, this is useless for pull-plays and sacrifices the timing/precision of well-practiced set plays. I\u0026rsquo;ve had the privilege of playing with excellent and intelligent defenders (two of whom are writing in this Issue) on my team who, in scrimmages, would tear apart set plays after seeing them just a few times. To me, the ability to react to dynamic situations with simple play- calls is more important than a really smooth team play.\n"

No matter the nomenclature, strategic genius, or underlying theory: what happens on paper matters little.\nIn general, I would say most team\u0026rsquo;s playbooks (and plays) are too complicated. Go simple. And a few simple rules are:\n1. Does the play work? (Not, \u0026ldquo;it would have worked if\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;)\n2. What is option B if the first pass doesn\u0026rsquo;t go as designed? Assuming first pass works, options for second and third passes get tricky. Be careful with being too prescriptive.\n3. What do you do when the opponent defends the play perfectly?\nOften it is dealing with number three that is player dependent. Your best handler or your smart role player whose been at every practice may bail things out if no one else recognizes what is happening, but that often puts you in a defensive position, re-grouping to get your O cranked up again. How well (and how quickly) you go from the plan not working out at all to something that puts pressure on the opposition is something you hope to get to with a set play, and your O in general. To practice that, just tell the D what\u0026rsquo;s coming.\nAll this said, commit to a few plays and get them down as a team. Run them over and over at some tourney.

They were down by 2 with seconds left and needed a quick bucket. LeBron was to cut hard to the hoop for an alley-oop. Magic forward Hedo Turkoglu had an idea what would happen and positioned himself between LeBron and the basket. As the play unfolded, LeBron took a few steps towards the rim, and Turkoglu sags off him. So LeBron changes course, v-cuts back to the arch, and drains a (ridiculous) game-ending three pointer.\nWinston Churchill once said: \u0026ldquo;Planning is essential, plans are useless.\u0026rdquo; LeBron had a good plan, but he noticed instinctually that his odds of succeeding would be better if he changed course. In Ultimate, like basketball \u0026amp; other sports, set plays are useful to designate a cutting order and give the thrower a good idea of how the field will unfold. I find them especially useful near the endzone, where the offense only needs to complete one short pass and individual cutters do not have much space to improvise in. At the same time, plays are guidelines, and smart players will always throw out the plan and capitalize when the defense presents them with good opportunities.\n"

He forwarded to them our \u0026ldquo;playbook.\u0026rdquo; But before we uncovered the leak, Zero and this team played in finals of Sectionals. Early in the game we got our first defensive possession, near our opponent\u0026rsquo;s endzone. Mark \u0026ldquo;Paco\u0026rdquo; Enright picked up the disc and called the audible for me to cut for an immediate swing. My defender switched his positioning to overplay the swing (knowing the audible). I switched my cut and caught a goal. Paco and I had four years of playing together, making the adjustment easy. The audible call was just a starting point for us. By the way, Sub Zero won finals. Perhaps our opponents relied too heavily on their inside information, and forgot they had to play the game. I have twice had access to—but never used—the playbook of a top ten club team whom we played at Club Nationals. In both cases these playbooks were obtainable because they were in a digital format, easily forwarded by email.\nAt Labor Day 2006 Sub played an opponent from another region. As I set up the d-line (I always do so with my back turned to our opponents so they can\u0026rsquo;t hear) I reminded the team of the audible for a handler weave after a turn. Then I noticed the captain of the opposing team standing in the back of our endzone listening to my play call. We didn\u0026rsquo;t use our weave audible for that game. Many times as a coach I hear the other team openly discussing (for example) the zone they are about to throw. What do I do? I tell my team to prepare for a zone. I don\u0026rsquo;t actively eavesdrop, but if the other team announces their strategy, I respond. As a coach, I consciously decide how much secrecy is required in making play calls, assuming other teams are listening. On occasion I feel that clarity of strategy is more important than secrecy. In those cases you might hear me yelling the force, or calling the transition to \u0026ldquo;Man D!\u0026rdquo; from the sideline. Other times I place a premium on surprise and secrecy.\nI do not consider any of the examples above cheating, or even unspirited. I give the above examples to illustrate two themes. First, as the sport evolves and elaborates, maintaining secrecy will become more important. I suggest all teams consciously protect their plays and audibles, especially digital documents that are easily copied and forwarded. Second, players win and lose a game, not plays. The best play is one that works even if your opponents know it. If your play self destructs as soon as your opponents decode it, it is not a play, it is a trap.\n"

  "content": "The trick to a good set play package is selecting the right plays for your team. Here are some basic guidelines:\n1. Make it worth your time. There is only so much your team can learn, so you want to make sure you are getting the most out of what you are practicing. If you are playing elite club ultimate, over half of your possessions are going to be off of the pull, so learn more pull plays. If you are playing college ultimate, only a third of your possessions are coming off the pull, so put more energy into transition plays (dead disc plays and fast breaks.) For example, Sockeye typically runs about 15 pull plays (40 in the play book) and 2 or 3 dead disc plays. This year, Oregon ran 3 pull plays and 2 dead disc plays.\n2. Keep it simple. The-best-play-of-all-time is also the simplest. Stand five guys on one side of the field and let your best player get open on the other. Who runs this play? Jam? Ironside? Sockeye? Carleton? Burning Skirts? Yes, yes, yes, yes and yes. I\u0026rsquo;m not a big believer in trickery. Learn a few simple plays, get really damn good at them and shove them down the other team\u0026rsquo;s throat.\n3. Space. The-best-play-of-all-time is also a classic example of managing space. Using the set circumstance of a pull, the offensive team can open up an entire sideline and the deep space for a single cutter, making it very difficult for the defender to cover all the options. It is also possible to organize the players on the field to take advantage of other kinds of space. The two commonly used formations are the German and the flat stack. I like the German because I think it gives the main cutter some nice side-to-side space that leads to some great downfield options. I don\u0026rsquo;t like flat stack plays very much because the lanes are too crowded and you have to move several cutters out of the way in order to make space for the intended target. Why not just start with them moved out of the way? Admittedly, things are a little different at the elite level because of the sophistication of the defenders, but the basic plan is the still to make space for a single cutter. An elite pull play might put three guys in motion, two of whom are making space and one of whom is the cutter using that space. I don\u0026rsquo;t think this is necessary at the college level; I have yet to see a college team consistently pull off the three-way switch necessary to shut down a pull play.\n4. Practice. And more practice.\nGood luck.\n"

  "content": "What makes a great play great is simplicity and creativity. It should be designed to have a main cut, but also a bail out. It should be taught on paper, on a whiteboard, with walk-throughs and at full speed. In the past, we have relied more on designing our own plays. My women\u0026rsquo;s club team has minimal to no plays, but the college team I coach has a playbook that they rely on probably 20% of the time off a dead disc situation. They are usually called by the handler picking up the disc or by a coach from the sideline. Personally, I would love to use them more, but there are only so many hours in the day.\nOne play that I have found to work at the women\u0026rsquo;s college level pretty successfully over and over again is a \u0026lsquo;double or single with cheese\u0026rsquo;. Vertical stack, player with disc being forced a direction (or they can be forced straight up). Player on front of stack curls break and takes off deep. Last person back or last two players back cut in hard open side. Huck goes to streaking deep player. Now, if it is a straight up mark, the player with the disc will yell out the play and the side they want to throw to. So, let\u0026rsquo;s say the play call is \u0026ldquo;Worthy\u0026rdquo; and the player loves their flick huck against a straight up mark. Flick huck would go to the home side. So, the player with the disc would yell out \u0026ldquo;Worthy, home!\u0026rdquo;\n"

  "content": "Steal, steal, steal. If you are the smartest play to have ever played the game, you may have reason to rely on your own originality. If not, find out who is—be it player, team, or just a better division—and how they position themselves to be successful. Any stoppage of play, between points, after timeouts, after violations, will allow you to see what they want to do, given the context on the field. Pay attention during your games. Scout opponents during your bye round. Watch film. Stealing from others may seem unoriginal, but ignoring available information about successful strategies makes your team worse than what it could be. Watch and learn, but remember what you\u0026rsquo;re looking for. Effectiveness in Ultimate is the combination of strategy and athletic ability; enough of one often makes up for a lack in the other. Unless you realistically plan on doing the same, ignore strategy that aims to out-muscle other teams—look for teams and plays that are successful even against superior athletes. Then use it like you drew it up yourself.\nAn example of a stolen play is one that comes (I believe, but who knows or cares?) from Vancouver\u0026rsquo;s Furious George. It can be run with any formation downfield, but it starts with the disc near the middle of the field, and two players on the sideline—one even with the disc, and one downfield. To start the play, the cutter even with the disc makes an up-line cut towards the middle of the field, and then goes deep. The cutter downfield near the side line then sprints parallel with the sideline back to the disc. Thrower gets the disc to the sideline to the downfield cutter, who then looks up to the handler cutter either continuing his cut deep, or coming underneath.\nThis play is currently run by most teams in the Northwest. We\u0026rsquo;ve all seen it many times, but it continues to work again and again. The reason for its continued success is what you should be looking for in a well designed set play: Its ability to force a defense to concede what the offense wants. When the defense knows this play is coming, it can adjust in a number of ways, but none of them (at least that I\u0026rsquo;ve seen or tried) could consistently provide a better outcome then what the offense wanted in the first place. The downfield cutter\u0026rsquo;s defender could come all the way around to stop the first cut under, but this would give the thrower, usually the offense\u0026rsquo;s best, a deep shot to a receiver with space. Deep help could come, but would also free their cutter to get an open look in the middle of the field. The mark could adjust to take away the sideline, but this gives up a dangerous downfield break opportunity. Zone defenses, full of holes themselves, lead to dangerous match-up problems later in the point. The defense is stuck—and forced to give the offense what it wants. Think as hard as you can how your plays can do the same—but if a different team or opponent is doing a better job, be smart enough to recognize as well as benefit from their work.\n"

  "content": "It was late 2007, and Western Washington University was fielding an alumni team at the Sundodger Invitational. It was early on Saturday—round one or two, and I believe we were playing Simon Fraser University. A nice group of lads if ever I\u0026rsquo;d seen. They had just put a goal in, and I was trotting back to line with Dave Bestock, Ben Wiggins, and Aly Lenon, among others.\nWhen we arrived to the line, Aly tells me to call a line. Now, I\u0026rsquo;ve called hundreds, if not thousands of lines in my time. Calling the 1, the 2, the 3; flat or vertical; defense on the turn—it has become an intuitive discipline. That morning it was cloudy, yet bright. I looked to the sky above, and it struck me like inspiration from the Gods.\n\u0026ldquo;Alright boys, let\u0026rsquo;s run the double flat stack.\u0026rdquo;\nNow, no one on the line had ever run, let alone heard of, the double flat stack, including myself. I received confused looks and guffaws of incredulity.\nLike Motzart\u0026rsquo;s pen to sheet music, the words from my lips were a seemingly divine revelation. Here\u0026rsquo;s how I remember it best:\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m the one, Ben you\u0026rsquo;re the two. Dave you\u0026rsquo;re the three. You and Reid are the deep stack. Start 50 yards deep. Aly you\u0026rsquo;re the four. You, Brian, and Jack are the short stack; start 25 yards out. You guys are the wickets. You have to stand completely still—we don\u0026rsquo;t want a Berkeley Pick Machine here. Dave, you gotta come screaming through those wickets—sprint as hard as you can—and as soon as you and your defender have cleared the wickets, make a sharp left turn and come across flat for the pass.\n\u0026ldquo;Reid you clear under to open up the endzone. Aly, as soon as Dave clears those wickets, your running a post route to the back right corner of the endzone. Outside-in flick huck from Dave. Score. Got it? Backhand on a turn.\u0026rdquo;\nMore confusion and incredulity.\nWe signaled for the pull. My team sets up. It looks beautiful—a 2-3-2 formation. I bring down the pull, center it to Ben. Dave takes his man out and then comes in, busting through the wickets, and curls flat for the pass. Aly takes off and gets a good jump on his man who looks pretty confused. Dave laces a floaty huck out in front of Aly, which gives him an easy catch to run on to in the endzone. Boom, boom, boom. Score.\nIf only that\u0026rsquo;s how it actually turned out. Alas, I had centered the disc to Ben who had (somewhat predictably) jammed the pass to Dave as he was just arriving at the wickets, not after he had curled. Dave\u0026rsquo;s defender got a hand on the disc, and we were on D. We ended up getting the disc back and scoring that point, but the double flat stack had failed.\nSo what can we learn from this story? Well, first, never call Ben Wiggins as the 2. Second, creativity and experimentation should be embraced, whether in offensives sets or plays. We\u0026rsquo;ve all been running the same stacks and defenses for twenty years. Mix it up a little. You could have good idea, which might turn into a great idea, which could potentially turn into a championship idea. Hey, it worked for Furious George and the \u0026ldquo;single\u0026rdquo; flat stack. Three UPA Club Championships later, it\u0026rsquo;s looking like one of the best ideas yet.\n"

  "issue": "021",
  "content": "Becoming a great cutter, like any ultimate skill, requires more than simply athleticism (though work at the track won\u0026rsquo;t hurt). It requires plenty of skill, thought, and practice. I think about cutting broken down into two components: the technique of the cut itself and cutting within an offensive system.\nCutting technique: As you start to work on your cutting technique, it\u0026rsquo;s useful to think about your strengths and role as a cutter. While there are some fundamental aspects of cutting that are universal across body types and positions, like driving your defender away from where you want to go to set up your cut, how you accomplish these fundamentals will vary both by cutting style and by what you are hoping to accomplish. Let\u0026rsquo;s consider first the fundamentals, and then we can focus on how to alter these strategies for position, body type, etc. I will highlight four fundamental techniques to cutting. All of these can and should be worked on consciously, both at practices and in your workouts.\n1. Control your defender\nControlling your defender is the most important part of good cutting. Good offense beats good defense. Why? Simple, the offense knows where it is going. However, offensive players shouldn\u0026rsquo;t take this for granted, but rather use it to their advantage. In cutting, the best way to accomplish this is by pushing or pulling your defender in ways that set up your cut. Sometimes this will take the form of driving right at your defender to get them on their heels before a change of direction. This type of cut works well as a lane cut. I like to think about stepping between a defenders feet right before making a hard cut, putting them on their heels. The second way to set up a defender is to pull them to a space that makes defense more difficult. If you want to cut break side, jog them to the open side to open up more space for the thrower to put the disc into. If you want to cut across the field on the open side, move them further to the break side and start calling for the disc before shooting across. The key is to be in control of your defender, not vice-versa. If you can get them to turn their hips away from where you want to go, you\u0026rsquo;ve won.\n2. Stay low through turns and chop your feet.\nForm is critical. Offense often has an initial advantage on cuts, but without good form, this is easily lost. Good cutting technique involves getting low with your hips, chopping your feet, and pumping your arms as you attack your turn. Shuttles, plyos, and speed ladders are good ways to work on this form. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget the arms, as they are equally important as quick feet in getting in and out of turns. Finally, with turns, find angles that allow you to keep some of your speed. If you come out of a turn with speed and the defender doesn\u0026rsquo;t, you\u0026rsquo;ll open up more space.\n3. Use fakes; they aren\u0026rsquo;t just for throwers\nFakes are a good way to accomplish goal #1, controlling your defender. Just like with throws, fakes set up your defender and allow you to open space on your cut. Head and other upper body fakes are a great way to do this. Practice turning your upper body away from where you want to go a second before you change direction and watch how your defender reacts. Change of speed, or stutter-step, fakes are another way to control your defender. On deep cuts, slow your pace to one second to freeze your defender, before continuing deep at full speed.\n4. Keep moving.\nYoung players biggest cutting problems typically stem from viewing it as an entirely stop and go enterprise. Good defenders will use any stoppage to reset their positioning, reducing your advantage. How you continue to move will depend on the offensive system you are playing in, but in any case, once a point begins never allow your defender to reset. If you are playing in a stack, keep making short cuts, adjusting your position, forcing the defender to lose disc-man vision. In a horizontal, you may have more freedom to job in your lane. In any case, continue to move, hopefully in a way that puts you in position for your next big gainer (more on this in a minute). If you do come to a stop, find moments when your defender looks away in order to start moving again. Any time a defender turns their head, when they turn back you should be in a new place.\nAll of the above rules need to be tailored to your cutting style and offensive role. Thinking about this individually will also help you to pick role models for cutting. Some players are able to use their quickness or explosiveness to rapidly change directions and so can accomplish goal #1 simply by cutting for a step or two before changing directions. Josh Zipperstein of Chain, Josh Wiseman of Revolver, and Damien Scott of Jam are good examples of these shorter cutting styles. Josh Z. and Damien show that this can be done in different ways, where Josh uses very quick feet and Damien uses a more powerful driving approach. This style of cutting will apply more to handlers, who often have to get open more rapidly late in the stall count.\nDownfield cutters and cutters that focus on speed more than quickness should work on elongating their cuts, driving their defenders further, and creating more space in which to use their speed. Many of the Sockeye lane cutters, like MC, are very effective at this style of cutting.\nCutting within an offense: Perhaps equally, if not more important, than individual cutting form is effective cutting within your team\u0026rsquo;s offense. A good cutter with bad timing is going to get far fewer discs than a lesser individual who knows his/her team\u0026rsquo;s system. While this is obviously going to be very team specific, here are two general issues that you can think about:\n1. Knowing the flow of the disc and using it to your advantage.\nYou know where the disc should go in your offense and the defender doesn\u0026rsquo;t. This presents several tactical advantages. The first is in relation to point number #1, controlling your defender. If your team is working on getting the disc on the break side for hucks, set up your defender by making in cuts to the offensive side, improving your positioning for the eventual break side bomb. Second, this allows you to move before the disc moves, making your defender lose disc-man vision and improving your knowledge of the field relative to them. If you know your team always dumps at 6, try starting to set up a cut for the dump at 5 and trust it will get there. Your defender has to defend you based on the first thrower, making it that much easier to get open for the second.\n2. Taking what the defense gives you vs. breaking the defense\nOne of the classic offensive debates is whether to take what the defense gives you versus trying to actively break the defense. While this often gets a lot of discussion in relation to the mark, it\u0026rsquo;s equally applicable to cutting. Defenders will normally take away chunks of the field. In addition to the open side, defenders will often position themselves to prevent the deep or in cuts. Cutters should vary their strategies based both on their successes/strengths and in order to keep the defense off balance. If a defender is giving you the disc in, take a couple of these easy in-cuts, before setting up a double-move: mimic your in-cut for a few seconds, wait for your defender to recognize and commit, and then break deep. The less predictable you are as a cutter to your defender, the harder it will be for them to know whether you are setting them up or making a real cut.\nIn all, cutting requires as much practice, skill, timing, and thought as throwing. You should think about where you want to attack, how you will set up your defender in order to attack that space, and the form you need to complete the cut. The rest is just hard work, but remember, if you do it right, your hard work beats the defender\u0026rsquo;s hard work.\n"

  "issue": "021",
  "content": "I should start by saying that I am an incredibly blessed ultimate player. For the past few years, I have had the coolest job in ultimate. \u0026ldquo;Go cover whoever you want, and when we get the disc, get it moving, then put it up. Your receivers will be Beau, Jolian, Mangan and Martin.\u0026rdquo; Uhhh, yes please? (I imagine Jeremy Cram felt the same way when he was choosing between Nord, Chase, Andrew Fleming and Mark Stone).\nIdeally, everyone on your team does everything well. Everyone is a threat both with and without the disc. But, of course, no team (with the possible exception of JAM in 2008) has an over abundance of complete players. I think the percentages of such players on the top teams rises each year as current players continue to develop their skill set and young players bring new skill sets each year, but even now every team seems to have a mix of specialists and general practitioners. Obviously, not all of the best athletes have the best throws and not all the best throwers are the most athletic, but each still contributes in a major way to their respective teams\u0026rsquo; success.\nSo where do you put your complete players? The people that are good at everything go where? Thinking simply, success is based on some combination of your offense holding serve more often than your opponent\u0026rsquo;s offense and your defense breaking more often than your opponent\u0026rsquo;s defense. Since both of these are factors, you want to put some of your complete players on offense and some on D.\nWhen playing offense, they should probably be a cutter (or at least have the option of going deep from a handler position) to maximize the offense\u0026rsquo;s options and force the defender to commit to stopping one direction (either in or out) with his/her positioning. You want the defender to feel screwed. If they stop the in and take away this player\u0026rsquo;s throws, this person is such an attractive and effective deep target that the offense will happily use hitting this player deep as a perfectly reliable plan A until the D decides to do something different. If you force them under, they wreak havoc on you with their throws. My prototype for this role is Mac Taylor. Other players that come to mind are Fortunat, Kurt Gibson, AJ Tiarsmith, Grant Lindsley, George Stubbs, Damien Scott, Mike Grant, John Hassell, Jeff Graham, Teddy Tripoli\u0026hellip;I could go on. Team USA is filled with players like this.\nWhen playing defense, your complete players should be handlers. The word \u0026ldquo;quarterback\u0026rdquo; comes to mind. I would say Ben Wiggins is that last true O-line quarterback. Other teams seem to have multiple players through which their offense can run. Defensive offenses tend to rely much more on one or two guys running the offense. There is usually a higher average level of disc skill on an O-line while defenses tend to have a higher average of athleticism. So disc skill is in greater demand on defense. If you have 7 solid athletes on, you want the ones with the most disc skill handling.\nAthletes and smart defenders get blocks. D handlers get breaks. So let\u0026rsquo;s build the ideal D handler.\nFirst things first, your not going to score if you can\u0026rsquo;t generate blocks, so you gotta have someone that is a fundamentally sound defender—Someone that understands downfield positioning and marking that can put significant pressure on his/her matchup over the course of the point. Ideally, the person is a totally badass athlete and absolutely dominates his/her match-ups consistently, but chances are that player could better serve your team as a target than a thrower. So acknowledging that this isn\u0026rsquo;t a role for your best athlete, I\u0026rsquo;d say you want a diverse athlete—someone that can play effective D on both receivers and handlers. It\u0026rsquo;s not always in the best interest of a team to put their D handlers on O handlers b/c on the turn, you never take your O player out of his/her comfort zone. Your opponent handles for part of the point, then he covers a handler after the turn. He\u0026rsquo;s always around the disc. He\u0026rsquo;s still doing what he does best and it\u0026rsquo;s tough to exploit him because chances are, if he\u0026rsquo;s handling on offense, he knows how to cover handlers as well. If you can mix it up and put at least one of your D-line handlers on a cutter, you can send him into squirrel mode off the turn. Cutters are often much less effective covering handlers than handlers. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing O cutters hate more than having to cover someone shorter than he is that doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop running. It\u0026rsquo;s annoying and difficult, and should you fail to score, renders him less effective with each subsequent O possession which pays off huge late in games.\nSecondly, you need someone that is comfortable being around and effective at handling the disc—a fundamentally sound thrower/decision maker with a good first step that can break the mark, run the reset and keep possession when the offense is struggling to gain yards off the turn. It helps, but is not necessary, to have a complete player in this role. It certainly gives you more options if your D handlers are also effective deep threats, but scoring percentages always go down when your best athlete makes an in cut and tries to huck it to your 5th best athlete. In general, it\u0026rsquo;s best to keep your D handlers around the disc unless they are being defended in such a way that there is an easy goal to be had. Third, you need this player to be dangerous with the disc. On a D-line, there is usually an abundance of sick athletes. You need a thrower that can put it out in front of these players where they can go do what they do best and make plays. Every good D-line puts the disc up. It\u0026rsquo;s icing on the cake to have good throwers in your downfield cutting lanes, but given that your handlers will touch the disc far more frequently, it\u0026rsquo;s best not to have to wait for a cutter to get the disc. You want to be able to throw a goal at any time from almost any place on the field. And you can\u0026rsquo;t do that if you don\u0026rsquo;t have good deep throwers handling.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s tough to say which attribute is most important. D handler is an interesting position b/c it\u0026rsquo;s rarely obvious who is going to be best at filling that role. All other positions at the club (O handlers, Deep D, Cutters) make themselves fairly obvious in tryouts, but D handlers don\u0026rsquo;t. Many teams put their best defenders on the field together and by default, the one or two guys with the best throws start handling. I think the best D handlers I know are made from either O handlers that commit to becoming more athletic or good defenders that commit to developing their disc skill. If I could only pick two attributes, they would be big throws and a good first step. Intelligence is actually much lower on my list. I think it\u0026rsquo;s the only position where careless, reckless idiots can still be highly effective.\nA D-line run by a poor decision maker with big throws and an itchy trigger finger is still going to score a ton of goals if he has good targets. A D-line run by a fundamentally sound decision maker with good fundamentals, but lacking the big throws or the quick first step is not going to do nearly as much damage. Most O-lines at the top level are excellent at getting the disc back, so your rewards decrease drastically if you have to make more throws. You will score more with the dumbass with big throws than with the genius that can\u0026rsquo;t put it up b/c you will have significantly more (many times over) looks at the endzone in each D possession.\nKeeping that in mind, the best D handlers couple intelligence and good decision making with the deadly first step and big throws.\nThe first player I ever played with that played this position exceptionally well was Colin \u0026ldquo;JV\u0026rdquo; Gottleib. When I was a freshman at CU, I noticed that the D got the disc almost every possession. When JV was in, the D scored and when he wasn\u0026rsquo;t, the D didn\u0026rsquo;t score. Part of it was having an under the radar Richter as a target to bail out the throws that didn\u0026rsquo;t go where they were supposed to; however what made him great were his quick first step, his unwillingness to stop running hard and his big throws from both sides. I modeled a great deal of my game from his. I\u0026rsquo;ve never seen offensive players look so beat at the end of points as when they were covered by JV and then had to chase him around the field.\nBrandon Malacek is probably single handedly responsible for bringing this position into the limelight during Wisconsin\u0026rsquo;s championships. It seemed like every time he got the disc he was putting it up. His throws were (are) huge, often pinpoint, and when they weren\u0026rsquo;t or when he made a poor choice, Shane, Drew and Lokke could almost always bail him out.\nJason Simpson currently fills this role for Chain, which always seems odd to me, because he\u0026rsquo;s a phenomenal athlete and receiver. But once Chain picked up Rob White and Zip, they started using his lefty backhand to get it out in front of them.\nStephen Poulos fills the role for Ring. That guy can chuck it a country mile.\nI think the world of Jeremy Cram for his disc skill, but I wish he would put it up more.\nMy prototype for the position is actually Kevin Cissna, despite the fact that he played mostly offense in his career. His first step verged on uncoverable, and he was athletic enough to cover receivers. He was thick and really strong, so if he ever played physical D, it was almost impossible to get anywhere near top speed. He was a great decision maker and had deep throws in the wind.\nNot to give too many props to UC-Davis, but Jeff Eastham is also on my short list. He continues to be one of the best deep defenders in the game, and while Jam prefers to use him as a receiver (they benefit from having a staggeringly high proportion of complete players), he would throw the bulk of goals for any other team\u0026rsquo;s D-line b/c he\u0026rsquo;s very quick and has huge throws.\n"

As far as I have seen, height cannot be taught or learned. Fortunately, there are several other factors that go into being an effective deep threat, all of which are much more learnable. I am going to discuss three skills in particular.\nThe first two skills are about making yourself an attractive looking target to the thrower. No matter how tall, fast, and good-looking you are, unless your teammate with the disc looks up and sees you going to the place to which she or he wants to throw at the right moment, you\u0026rsquo;re not going to get many bombs sent your way. From where you set up your deep cut and your timing are crucial to getting open and getting thrown to. At UGA, I played with a guy named Amble Johnson. Amble was about 5'10\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; and was one of the two slowest guys on the team (If you are reading this Amble, I\u0026rsquo;m sorry. But it\u0026rsquo;s true.) but he caught as many deep goals as anyone on the team. He\u0026rsquo;d set up his cuts by constantly repositioning himself in response to where the disc moved. This kept his defender engaged and unable to keep track of both the thrower and Amble. As soon as he saw the disc in the air on it\u0026rsquo;s way to a thrower in a power position (i.e. coming up the line or off of a swing cut) Amble would take a couple of quick steps towards the thrower to create more space behind him into which a deep pass could be thrown. He\u0026rsquo;d time his cut so that right as his teammate caught the disc and looked up field he\u0026rsquo;d see Amble taking of towards the endzone with plenty of space out in front of him.\nMost throwers prefer to throw bombs within the first two or three seconds of catching the disc, before the defender gets a chance to set a good mark. If you time you cut so that the thrower sees you going right as he or she looks up you\u0026rsquo;ll be a lot more likely to be thrown to. In terms of from where your cut should originate, don\u0026rsquo;t be too far away from the thrower. It\u0026rsquo;s nearly impossible to throw a leading pass to a receiver who starts her or his cut from far away. Even though floaty passes sometimes make for exciting plays, leading passes that hit receivers in stride are a good team\u0026rsquo;s bread and butter.\nAim your cut towards the back of the endzone rather than the sideline so the thrower won\u0026rsquo;t have to worry as much about putting it out of bounds. Try to avoid cutting directly away from the thrower because it forces the thrower to either throw straight over your head which is difficult to read, or to send a pass with a lot of bend which is difficult to throw. If you are cutting for the thrower\u0026rsquo;s forehand you should start your cut from the backhand side of the thrower\u0026rsquo;s body and head towards the back of the endzone on the forehand side. The reverse is true if you are cutting for a backhand.\nThe final and perhaps most important part of becoming a threatening deep receiver is to become a strong thrower. If you cannot throw well, you are a one dimensional player. A smart defender will just stay behind you at all times forcing you to come back towards the disc because she or he is not worried about you hurting his or her team with your throws. If you can throw, any cut you make towards the disc is much more of a threat to your defender because you are a weapon with the disc in your hands. Your defender will bite a lot harder when you fake in and it will be that much easier to get him or her off balance and get open going away. A good example of a deep player who became dominant once he learned to throw is Kurt Gibson. Kurt\u0026rsquo;s first two years at Florida he was a great athlete and made a number of exciting plays but once defenders started picking up on the fact that he wasn\u0026rsquo;t a great thrower, they just stayed behind him and took away his strength. Kurt\u0026rsquo;s junior year he became a great thrower and he became nearly uncoverable because if his defenders backed him, he\u0026rsquo;d get the disc easily and throw goals. He forced the guy covering him to basically pick him poison. Either let Kurt catch goals or throw goals. Tough choice. Florida went from not making nationals Kurt\u0026rsquo;s sophomore year to winning it all his junior year largely because he learned to throw well.\nEven if you aren\u0026rsquo;t overwhelmingly endowed with the genetic advantages of being fast, explosive, and tall, if you start you deep cuts from the right place, time them well, and make yourself a great thrower, you will be well on your way to becoming a strong deep threat.\n"

  "issue": "021",
  "content": "A great defensive handler first and foremost plays defense. The defensive unit will only get a handful of opportunities to try to score; most of their time spent on the field will be defending. To be valuable to their team, a defensive handler will need to produce more than they give up, and the offense has a big advantage to start with. Effective defending from a variety of positions is well covered in other issues of The Huddle.\nAside from defending, there are a few attributes that separate among defensive handlers the great from the rest, and those attributes are largely based on the realities of playing with defensive units. Among the top teams today, most put their smartest, most experienced players on offense, usually taking those with the best disc skills with them. As most defensive units attempt to specialize at defending, they spend relative to offensive far less time practicing their offense sets. Further, most offensive teams are kept intentionally small, while defensive teams take the remaining 14 or so players. With any weather affecting play, defensive teams tend to defend downwind most of the points. So how does a great defensive handler manage to get a less-experienced, less-practiced team with far fewer disc skills to score upwind? Among the greats that I have watched and played with, a few factors have stood out:\nUse Only What is Needed\nOffensive players will generally be put in enough situations to utilize their strengths. Over the course of a game, and even a tournament, defensive handlers will be limited in available options. The pressure to force their strength on the situation is usually the greatest on defensive handlers, and the best ones I\u0026rsquo;ve seen have been extremely patient to use only what would work, instead of what they thought they could do.\nBe an Effective Reset\nAs the effectiveness of cutters goes down, the number of dumps thrown goes up. Great defensive handlers are able to consistently provide an open, safe throw for players with less disc skills in order to maintain possession.\nBreak the Mark\nSimilarly, as the downfield cutters are less able to get free on the open side, breaking the mark becomes even more important. A great handler for the D-team will be confident and able to break the same mark repeatedly in the same point.\nBe Comfortable at High Stall Counts\nWhile usually wise to move the disc to the first open option, a great defensive handler might need to deal with several high stall counts per possession, as open options might be few and far between. The ability to maintain composure to get out of high stall situations is often the difference between a turnover and a break.\nDeal With Weather\nThe great defensive handlers I\u0026rsquo;ve played with have been able to do all of the above in the wind. When the weather gets more difficult, even more pressure gets put onto the handler, as lesser throwers will be even more reluctant to take risks with the disc.\nWhile hardly comprehensive, these attributes stand out the most in the great defensive handlers I have played with, from high school to Club Nationals. These aren\u0026rsquo;t fixed: you can improve your own ability with every one of them, and doing so will help your team\u0026rsquo;s chances to score breaks.\n"

  "content": "Every team has its own style of play and I think it is hard to pick out characteristics that make a great defensive handler—or any other position—without considering it in the context of a specific team. That said, I have noticed that good defensive lines are able to use the chaos of a turn to their advantage. Some teams try to pick up the disc right away and move it quickly to make it difficult for the other team to set up a defense while others take their time to set up an organized offense. Either way, I think one of the biggest factors of successfully scoring off a turn is the on-field leadership skills of the defensive handlers.\nNancy Sun, who was a defensive-line handler for Brute Squad for several years and now captains Fury, stands out in my mind as one of the best on-field handler \u0026ldquo;quarterbacks\u0026rdquo; that I\u0026rsquo;ve played with. Although she prefers a slower set-up off a turn, she is able to recognize when a fast break opportunity is available—based on how many people are downfield, their position, mismatches, etc.—and use it to the team\u0026rsquo;s advantage. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t hurt that she has great long and break throws to open up more opportunities on the field.\nNurit Bloom, who played for Brute Squad for several years, is another example of a great defensive handler. She not only creates turns with her physical and smart defense, but she is able to move the disc quickly, making it difficult for the opposing team to set up their defense after a turn. She doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the long throws that other handlers do, but she creates other opportunities with her break throws and quick disc movement.\nMaureen McCamley, who plays for Lady Godiva, also stands out as a great defensive handler but for a different reason. In addition to having great, physical defense and beautiful long throws, she also has fantastic pulls. In my opinion, any woman who can consistently put the disc in a favorable position off the pull (back left corner of the end-zone, for example), while playing decent defense, should earn playing time on an elite club team.\n"

  "content": "There\u0026rsquo;s a lot more to being a great handler than meets the eye. Being one of the better throwers on your team is important. But there have been plenty of teams on which the best thrower is not a handler, especially when it comes to hucking. This isn\u0026rsquo;t say that being a great thrower doesn\u0026rsquo;t help a handler be great. Rather, there are a lot of factors and skills that make some handlers particularly effective.\nGetting the disc\nAny good handler can deliver a disc after receiving the first pass after a pull. But the best handlers are able to get open during the normal flow of a point a high percentage of the time. Of particular importance is being able to get open for a relatively easy dump throw. A number of factors contribute to a handler being able to get open, though a few a especially important:\nKnow your position. Great handlers are able to more effectively get open by actively positioning themselves in relation to the both the disc and their defender in a way that makes it easier for them to cut or receive the disc. One player that I learned the value of positioning from when I first arrived on the club scene was Dan Rydel (Surly, Sub Zero). Dan is not your typical fast-twitch kind of handler, but he is able to get the disc often and easily because he positions himself so that the person with the disc can see him and his defender is forced to choose to take away perhaps one cutting option, leaving others options open.\nCut to get open. We\u0026rsquo;ve all heard someone on the sideline yell \u0026ldquo;Stop dancing!\u0026rdquo; before. Getting the disc as a handler is much easier if you sell your cut. In other words, cut like you mean it. Driving 4-5 steps (as opposed to 1-2) in one direction puts your defender on her heels and, ideally, forces her to turn her hips because she believes you\u0026rsquo;re actually going to keep going. As soon as this happens, you\u0026rsquo;ll be much more likely to be open when you cut in the other direction. Someone who does this better than anyone I\u0026rsquo;ve played with or against before is Kevin Cissna (Jam). His reliability as a dump was due in part to his ability to drive his defender in one direction before switching directions and being open by a couple of yards.\nGo deep! One of the best ways to put your defender on her heels is to go deep to be on the receiving end of a huck from time to time. Doing so forces your defender to respect the deep cut option, which will help to free you up around the disc more. Think Kobe Bryant driving to the basket the first couple of times down the floor in order to put his defender on his heels and set up an easy pull-up jumper the next time down. There are a lot of handlers that are willing to go deep, but among the more effective that I\u0026rsquo;ve seen are Jeff Cruckshank (Furious George) and Fortunat Mueller (DOG/Boston).\nGetting rid of the disc\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve got the disc, being a great thrower only gets you so far. The best handlers do more than hit deep cuts in stride or slice through a zone defense. I\u0026rsquo;ve been fortunate to play with Damien Scott (Jam) for a few years, and the things I mention below (as well as those mentioned above) are all things that Damien does superbly.\nBreak the mark. The best handlers in the game can break the mark effectively, and do so often. Breaking the mark opens up the field and forces both the mark and downfield defenders to play more honest defense. It also leads to my second point here\u0026hellip;\nSet up your teammates for success. Putting a huck out in front of a teammate so she can catch the disc in stride for a goal is an obvious way to set up a teammate. But often, really great handlers aren\u0026rsquo;t necessarily the ones throwing the goal. They make the throw that sets up their teammate to throw the goal. Breaking the mark is one really effective way to set up your teammate. Once she gets the disc on the break side, she will have a second or two with a great look down the field for an easy throw to the break side while her defender is trying catch up and put the mark on.\nDo the little things right. I\u0026rsquo;m stealing a favorite of Team USA coach Greg Connelly here. But it\u0026rsquo;s absolutely true. There\u0026rsquo;s no doubt that great handlers have physical skills that allow them to make great throws. But often the thing that separates the best from the rest is the fact that the best often do the little things right. Among the many little things, here are a few:\n1. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to fake with the disc, especially when you first receive the disc. This immediately puts the mark on her heels.\n2. Take the easy throw to keep the disc moving. Some handlers with great throws hold on to the disc, looking off easy under throws in hopes that a great look deep will open up. This often hurts an offense more than it helps.\n3. Face your dump and look to your dump early. Facing your dump allows you to establish eye contact with her, lets you see how she means to get open, and puts you in balance and ready to throw from either side of your body. The less time you give yourself to get off a dump throw, the greater chances the exchange will result in a turnover.\n"

  "title": "Handling: Vision",
  "author": "Deb Cussen",
  "issue": "021",
  "content": "Having great throws is one thing, but what makes a great handler is how those throws are used. A lot of characteristics that apply can be said about any great player, like the ability to consistently get open, especially late in the stall, and in a dangerous place to make the next throw. The great ones blend taking opportunities and making opportunities. With handlers, I think what separates the great ones, beyond just having great throws, is vision.\nVision involves being able to see the field; the whole field, not just the primary cutters or the play in motion. Spaces are opening and closing, cutters are changing directions and speeds. A great handler takes all of this in, anticipating cutters\u0026rsquo; motions to hit a new space she\u0026rsquo;s cutting into, or hitting her just as she plants and turns under for max yardage gain. Reads the body language of a poacher as he starts to step off his man, pump fakes to get him to bite and then hits his man on the break side. That weak-side handler or h-stack cutter sneaking down the far sideline can catch his defender sleeping when the handler sees it developing and puts up the throw.\nBesides reading the field in the moment, a great handler will anticipate changes on the field over the course of a game. Every defense gives up something, and having vision is knowing where the vulnerabilities lie and how to take advantage of them using those great throws. A great handler will also manipulate the defense, capitalizing on areas of weakness and forcing them to change, opening new opportunities to strike. Take a few deep shots early in the game in order to set up the easy, big yardage gain in-cuts later in the game when the defense starts backing. Throwing a few swings around the cup and entice the off-mark to slide over away from the middle into that lane and bite on a fake, then hit a popper through the cup.\nAll of these scenarios involve solid decision-making based on calculated risks. A great handler knows when that big incredible throw is likely to pay off, and when it\u0026rsquo;s better to rely on the consistent throws and basic offensive strategy.\n"

  "content": "Great defensive handlers are typically people who are aggressive, able to see the field really well, and have a solid understanding of when it is appropriate to play transition offense. In my opinion, one of the most important parts of being a defensive handler is leading your team when you guys do get the D. This may be calling a play, running to the disc to transition, creating space for a teammate, or cutting to get the disc off the transition. I think one of the most brutal things to have happen to your team is to turn the disc over and have the other team score within 2-3 passes. Therefore, if you are a defensive handler your goal should be to move the disc away from the defense immediately and start marching up the field.\nOne player who is an amazing example of a defensive handler, who I have been lucky enough to be teammates with, is Andrea \u0026ldquo;Chowda\u0026rdquo; Jung. She is and incredible defender and because she is such a threat as a thrower she runs our offense right off of the turnover. By Chowda getting the offense going quickly, the other team can\u0026rsquo;t get the right match ups quickly, and we have the opportunity for an easy score.\n"

  "title": "Well-Rounded Deep Threats",
  "author": "Gwen Ambler",
  "issue": "021",
  "content": "In my experience, the toughest match-ups on receivers are against those players that are as big a threat going deep as they are coming under. Playing defense against a player like this, it is not obvious how you should play them. If you force them away, they\u0026rsquo;ll burn you deep and/or sky you for the score, but if you force them in, they\u0026rsquo;ll have a chance to use their throws to put the disc into the endzone.\nLeslie Calder in her prime is the perfect example of this type of player. As an incredible athlete, she had a great top speed, could turn on a dime, jumped well, had amazing hands, and could lay-out for passes that were well out of range for most players. Her throws were also superb, and she could break the mark and huck with pin-point accuracy. Being a lefty also helped her team as she could open up the field in different ways from her teammates. Miranda Roth and Georgia Bosscher both earned Callahan awards for this type of double- threat play.\nAgainst players that have only one clear superpower, it\u0026rsquo;s easier to plan ahead to take that threat away, even if they are really, really good at that one thing.\nFor this reason, I think that receivers with big aspirations should make sure and not focus exclusively on the skills that get them open (speed, turning, explosiveness, juking, timing) or that secure the disc in their hands (catching technique, reading the disc, lay-outs, hops), but also need to make sure that they can be potent once they have possession (fakes, breaks, hucks, field vision, decision making).\nIt takes time to develop into that type of well-rounded player, so first a receiver would need to make sure and become at least a single-threat by being able to get open reliably. In my opinion, the easiest way to do this is through working on timing and learning how to get a defender on her heels. If you could work on one physical aspect, I would suggest focusing on top speed.\n"

  "title": "What Else Makes A Good Handler?",
  "author": "Cara Crouch",
  "issue": "021",
  "content": "Many players in Ultimate have good throws, but that does not necessarily mean that they are great handlers. The key to becoming a great handler is combining the mechanics of good throws and a versatile throwing repertoire with three big picture attributes: awareness, communication, and mind set/attitude.\nThe first characteristic of a great handler is awareness, or vision. The ability to evaluate the field at a moment\u0026rsquo;s notice is crucial for calling plays, or dictating what you want as a thrower. What is the positioning of your offenders and their defenders? Whose defender is out of position? Are there poachers about? Has someone set up particularly well for a deep cut? Great handlers can also apply this keen awareness to their mark in a very short time period. What plane is the mark taking? Are they sitting heavy on the inside out or outside in? As soon as you figure these things out, take what they are giving you or throw from a plane that is not parallel to theirs by stepping towards or away from them. The last mark of a great handler in the awareness category is to open your vision. The hardest handlers to mark do not follow individual cuts with their eyes; they use their peripheral vision and scan the field instead of following one cutter at a time. Just a note on this: it is helpful if your team establishes what order you want to scan the field in. For example, some teams scan deep early in the count, then open side, break side, and finally the dump space at a higher count. I learned to expand my vision the hard way by getting hand blocked by Miranda Roth, a great handler. I also learned to expand my throwing repertoire to include more creative throws by observing and playing against Roth.\nCommunication is the second responsibility of a good handler. When you have the disc you are in control of the game for that short amount of time. You have the ability to dictate the play by communicating with your cutters about what you want or do not want, and this can be done through verbal or non verbal communication. Verbal communication might involve an established play call or basic directive to a player. Non-verbal communication might involve more subtle means of communicating through a pump fake, head nod, eye movement, hand gesture, or another subtle body cue. Lastly, good handler communication does not only occur on the field. Be vocal with your teammates about what kind of cuts you like to throw to or spaces you particularly look to hit.\nThe last quality of a great handler is mind-set. While playing on Ozone, I observed Angela Lin and Holly Sommers exude a calm confidence with the disc that I tried to mimic as a young handler. Besides exhibiting the knowledge that you are in control, know when to take risks and do it confidently, do not be too hard on yourself for poor execution (vs. poor decisions), and be aggressive about quick movement. Lastly, and perhaps most difficult for the aging Ultimate player in all of us, try to avoid falling into \u0026ldquo;the handler trap\u0026rdquo; mind-set of getting stuck behind the disc. The line between stealth and sloth is thin and blurry, so if you are inactive make sure it is serving a purpose.\nMatthew Sewell once told me that Ultimate is 60% skill/athleticism and 40% confidence. Although I am sure he was exaggerating the percentages to instill confidence in a young player, he was absolutely right about the necessity of a confident and aggressive attitude. That mind-set, combined with good communication and a keen awareness, will help turn a good thrower into a great handler.\n"

If you don\u0026rsquo;t actually have 7 players who believe you can actually win, then this isnt worth reading and the rest of your game isn\u0026rsquo;t worth playing.\nMost teams I have played on, in this situation, would try and load the Defensive line with the top defenders. However, your goal isn\u0026rsquo;t just to stop the offense and gain possession, but to actually catch the disc in the endzone. So loading your defensive unit with pure defenders might not be the best way to make the comeback a reality. Instead, I would put a majority of the top defenders on, but also 2-3 of the smart offensive players (most likely handlers). In club, players are more experienced, more versatile, and more confident, so this doesn\u0026rsquo;t apply quite as much, but for college, this seems to be an important component.\nThe main justification for placing a average defender, but good offensive player, on at a crucial point of the game is that having the normal defensive unit doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to have been working so changing things up is a necessity, let alone, scoring now has more weighting on the d line than before. The oppositions O team is probably playing loose and in their element having a substantial lead late in the game, so putting some breaks on the board is necessary to make them tighten up and lose some confidence. Also, having 2 solid offensive handlers step onto the D line will give some patience and set the pace upon getting the disc. The D-team may be feeling the pressure to put breaks up which will cause the Defensive O to not play their game. Placing some offensive players changes the psychology, mentality, and attitude of the line and can help get them out of the rut they may previously have been in.\nOverall, you have to change a losing strategy. Whether it be on offense or defense, you always have to adapt to help make the team play to their potential.\n"

You must call tight lines—having players in the games that can create Ds and capitalize on them is imperative. Now is not the time to give players a chance to show their stuff for the first time—use people that are tried and true on D and O. This may mean that these players are playing a lot, but thems the breaks—they ought to be in good enough shape to hang tough through this time. In terms of strategy, it might be time to change something up. If your D has been creating Ds but you just haven\u0026rsquo;t been able to score, you may think about switching to focusing on either fast-breaking or settling down. If your D has not been creating Ds, you might consider trying a new D.\nIn the 2008 Women\u0026rsquo;s Final, which was probably the best comeback to ever occur in ultimate, Fury changed their D sometime around halftime or right after the second half started. It was windy and we run a two handler crashing from behind zone offense. They switched to guarding our crashing handler almost like a box-and-1 with a huge cup around them. This flustered our handlers and we were unable to adapt, opening the door for a huge and devastating comeback by them. I\u0026rsquo;m guessing that they just took it point by point or broke the points into games to three. Oftentimes teams can be successful just focusing on shorter goals rather than thinking, \u0026ldquo;we have to score 10 times to be back in this game.\u0026rdquo; On an individual level, it is important not to focus too much on yourself and take too much of the responsibility of catching up, even if you are playing a lot at this crucial time.\n"

  "content": "One thing I remember an old teammate saying was that \u0026ldquo;there are no four- pointers in Ultimate.\u0026rdquo; What he meant was that you\u0026rsquo;re not going to bridge the gap in one play, so you have to stay with the gameplan and keep doing the things that your team needs to do to play their best.\nThe first key is to make sure that your offense is going to score every time they receive, because the worst thing for the team would be to add another break, which only lengthens the odds of a comeback while also being demoralizing. Also, if they are scoring without giving up even a turnover the other team will start feeling some pressure.\nDefensively you\u0026rsquo;re going to have to ratchet up the intensity a bit. One mistake I think is to get away from playing zone or junk because you are afraid of matchups or want to force the other team. After many losses I have thought to myself that we didn\u0026rsquo;t mix up the defense enough in the second half of the game and while our defensive intensity was strong, we didn\u0026rsquo;t do enough to keep the other team\u0026rsquo;s offense on their toes. If your gameplan includes mixing up defenses, you need to keep with that plan even when you are down late in the game.\nAs for subbing, I think you want to stay with your team\u0026rsquo;s plan, maybe trying to give your stars an extra point or two. Of course, this depends on the situation. If you\u0026rsquo;re a college team and it\u0026rsquo;s early in the season there is no more valuable time to see what the younger players are made of than to put them into the fire. Even if they don\u0026rsquo;t pull it off, the experience they get will be helpful come sectionals or regionals, much more valuable than burning out your stars but winning the game only to get slaughtered in the next round of the tourney. However, if it is potentially the last game of your season then you may tighten up the rotation a bit. However, I think teams feed off the energy of having everyone in the game and the successful teams I have been on have played all their players, even in championship games.\n"

  "title": "Short, Aggresive Risks",
  "author": "Lindsey Hack",
  "issue": "020",
  "content": "As a coach, I feel it is necessary to take some risks defensively and call a few different defensive looks that may create enough confusion and lead to a quick turnover by the offense. If you have been playing man the entire game, try a little zone. If you have been forcing one way the entire time, try some middle or straight up. At that point, you must try something different to get the other team out of their comfort zone because clearly, they are comfortable right now in the driver\u0026rsquo;s seat.\nAs a player, I say it is all about games to 3. Forget about the big score and know that you have to start dominating games to 3. If you win the next game 3-0, the score is now 11-10. If you go 3-1, the score is now 12-10—totally winable. If you think that you have to win a game to 5 or four, that suddenly becomes a much higher mountain to climb.\nCalling lines will depend on what defenses you decide to run. Although it would be ideal to put a lot of defense out on the field every defensive point, it may be more intelligent to go with smart defenders with some offensive talent as your D line must score or it is game over. Therefore, there is going to have to be a healthy mix of D line players and O line players who can play smart D and help you score efficiently once you get the D.\n"

  "content": "The opportunity to be successful in the face of difficult odds is created long before you\u0026rsquo;ve been put in to that situation. It is an attitude that is built in practices, team meetings, and work-outs from the beginning of the season. The focus needs to be on what you and your team have control over in any given moment. Things that you do not have control over include the score of the game—those scores are now part of the past and we are unable to have any affect on it. What we do have control over are:\nOur Decisions. Continuing to make the right decisions on the field. This includes each individual being responsible for the parts of the game that we have designated. The mark is responsible for taking away the break side of the field—they are not responsible for getting a handblock on a throw to the open side. That D is the responsibility of the downfield defenders. Similarly, on offense when we get the disc we need to continue to move the disc to the next open receiver in our offense trusting that the team will make the plays, not the individual.\nOur Effort. At any given moment we have control of how we exert ourselves on the field. We need to be giving 100% effort throughout a point—cutting, defending, marking and then after the point we can put someone else on the field that can match that effort.\nOur Intensity. This is the level of \u0026ldquo;arousal\u0026rdquo; that each individual has. How quickly we process and react to stimulus. Each player has an optimal intensity level for peak performance and it is each players\u0026rsquo; responsibility to identify their optimal level and how they get there.\nOur Attitude. Bringing a positive attitude that lifts up our teammates and motivates them further. This will be particularly present from a loud and supportive sideline. Our sidelines will high five and lift up our teammates regardless of whether we score a point or if we get scored on.\nThe mnemonic I use for these controllables is \u0026ldquo;IDEA\u0026rdquo; or Pai \u0026ldquo;DEIA.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat I would tell my players is a combination of the above—that, ultimately, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if we win or lose the game but it does matter that we focus on what we have control over for each and every moment of the remainder of the game. That everyone will play a role whether your on the field or on the sideline and that when we come back and win it will be a team effort and a team victory.\n"

  "title": "Two Scenarios For A 2nd Half Comeback",
  "author": "Charlie Reznikoff",
  "issue": "020",
  "content": "Scenario #1. Your opponent has a short roster. In the first half they got breaks early. But they are starting to look tired and predictable in their offense. You have identified their play-makers. Your D line has already generated some grueling points for their O line. Meanwhile your team has legs, intensity, they just can\u0026rsquo;t cash in with breaks. In this scenario I\u0026rsquo;d turn up the defensive intensity with a straight up mark, specific match ups, and hard physical D. Take the other team\u0026rsquo;s key players out of their preferred game: make their thrower go deep, make their deep cutter throw, face guard the handler. Disrupt their initial play with a straight up mark, poaching off the dump handler, forcing into the stack, transition junk, or whatever. Above all, they should never get a one-pass-goal. Also unleash the team freak in the huddle, get everyone jacked, and let a frenzy loose on the field. Avoid stoppages of play and long discussions. After the turn, empower your key throwers to take deep shots. If you don\u0026rsquo;t get the goal, you at least have reset their offense against your smothering D. Bottom line: against a tiring team, disrupt the initial play then fall into smothering physical defense with quick transition.\nScenario #2. Your opponent is in rhythm and looking good. They show no signs of letting up. The match ups are not in your favor. Your defense is frustrated. Here you zone. Many teams don\u0026rsquo;t rely on zones in big moments, and that is unfortunate. If you know and trust two zones, you can change momentum in such a game. Start with your strongest zone. If your opponent takes a time out to discuss their offense, switch your zone. Throw in a point of intense man D after a few points of zone. Never let them regain their rhythm. Up to this point your D line has not had many offensive possessions. They\u0026rsquo;ve watched your opponents score at will. Commonly your D line will fritter away break opportunities with impatience. I\u0026rsquo;d emphasize to the team playing within itself and within the team\u0026rsquo;s offense. Challenge your team to out-think your opponent. Bottom line: against a team in rhythm, switch up your defenses and play methodical offense after a turn.\nWhat not to do? Cheat. Often a second half deficit means travel calls, excessive fouling-and-contesting, doubling-teaming zones, etc. At times this is incidental to ratcheting up the intensity. Cheating shows the team\u0026rsquo;s lack of actual strategy. In any case (and I\u0026rsquo;ve been on teams like this), bad calls usually result in poor focus and lower energy for your own team. Against good teams, bad calls will allow them to slow the game down, rest, think, and reset their offense. Making key travel calls might get you some wins. But it will prevent you from learning how to actually stop the throw, and you will not grow as a player. My objection to cheating is not only moral. It\u0026rsquo;s practical. It usually does not work.\n"

  "issue": "019",
  "content": "I don\u0026rsquo;t remember ever thinking \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s time for a layout block\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;I need to be in a position to get a layout block on this throw.\u0026rdquo; My goal was simply to be in the best position I could be in to cover the person who was my responsibility at the time. I believe that layout blocks are simply \u0026lsquo;opportunities taken\u0026rsquo;—being in the right place at the right time, and the offense made just enough of a mistake for you to go get it. However, there are a few situations where simple choices can put you in a slightly better position for that elusive layout block. I\u0026rsquo;ll describe one of the common ones here.\nDefensive positioning is often about angles. As the defender, you want to own the better angle to the disc after it is thrown. So, here\u0026rsquo;s the situation: You are covering an upfield cutter who makes a cut on an angle towards the open side of the field, as shown in figure 1. This cut does happen in both vertical and horizontal stacks, although the angle may be less when the cut is in the horizontal stack.\nAs the cutter makes the cut, you the defender may become increasingly out of position. You\u0026rsquo;ll be on the outside of the receiver and then the receiver owns the angle.\nMany of the layout blocks that I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten, have been in this situation. Instead of staying on the outside or trying to stay in front of the receiver, I slide back a step and take the inside. I do this after the angle of the throw gets to be to the receivers advantage if I stay on the \u0026lsquo;force side.\u0026rsquo;\nWhen the throw goes up, you the defender are now in position to make that layout block—you own the angle. The same theory applies to other situations on the field.\n"

  "title": "Baiting",
  "author": "Brett Matzuka",
  "issue": "019",
  "content": "This is a skill that many of the top defenders possess which generates lots of lay out blocks. There are 3 key components to a successful baited block.\n1. Knowing the offense (thrower/cutter)\nTo many, this is just knowing how far away you can let your player get before you can\u0026rsquo;t make up the ground in time to get a bid on the pass. Knowing how much ground you can make up on your player when the disc goes up is the most important part to knowing the offense; if you can\u0026rsquo;t regain the ground when the disc is thrown, you surely won\u0026rsquo;t get the block. However, also knowing the current offensive circumstance and the thrower will be the icing on the cake. A good thrower is patient and confident with the disc and will look off an even slightly questionable pass for another option, or if they choose to throw it, are more likley to place it far enough away to prevent the opportunity for a bid. An average thrower, however, will be more likely try to unload the disc quickly, which should give you the opportunity for the baited block. Other key factors to consider are: Did the thrower just receive the disc with a zero count, or is the count high? are they trapped on the line or at center field? Is the there offensive flow currently or not? All these questions will have a big affect on whether the bait and bid is successful, or whether you may overcommit and expose your defense to a devastating blow.\n2. Be on your toes (literally)\nIf you are baiting for a block, be ready to actually get the block. Too many times a defender has given up a few steps unintentionally, sees the impending throw to their man, and actually manages to make up the ground but doesn\u0026rsquo;t get in position to convert the block. To turn this from a run past and expose your defense to an unmarked man to a lay out D, you have to prepare a few steps before you are within striking distance. Simply put, when you are 3 to 4 steps away from making a play, get low and maximize the amount of spring you can get from your legs, (much like a lay up in basketball) take your 2-3 short step routine to prepare to explode, and then execute. If you don\u0026rsquo;t prepare to bid a few steps before, it will pass you by.\n3. Desire\nThis sounds cheesy and much like a cliche, but it is honestly the truth. You can have both of the above and still not manage to get the block. This last part completes the package. You give the offensive player enough steps to look like a viable option while still maintaining enough distance to make a bid. The throw goes up and you make up the ground while preparing for the bid by getting low and going through the lay out routine. However, if you lack the passion, determination, or desire, you will hear a lot of people congratulating you on a nice bid, and just that, bid, not D. Desire here isn\u0026rsquo;t just defined as your thirst for the disc, but as the focus and attention to any inconsequential detail or deviation that might potentially prevent the bid from becoming a block. That millisecond that you explode horizontally into the air, you have to be so focused and hungry for the disc that you keep your eye locked onto the disc (where it is going, where the offensive player plans to catch it, etc.) and position your body, limbs, and hands in a way to deflect/catch the disc while accounting for any deviation from your initial preparation that has occured along the flight path. This, simply put, is desire. Not letting any hiccup prevent you from making your lay out eventuate into a D.\nIf you can manage to learn these 3 components, hurling yourself through the air will be the easy part that puts the icing on the cake.\n"

Because they should be too mentally taxed from keeping the stall count each time they step on the field for D. I\u0026rsquo;m not talking about counting the stall when marking your assignment; I\u0026rsquo;m talking about keeping the stall when playing D in the stack or spread. Any O player doing the same thing at stall 4 and stall 8 is giving their defender at chance at the grail. Of course you can\u0026rsquo;t do it every possession of every point of every game early in the series and you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t need to do it you\u0026rsquo;re a 1 seed facing a 16 seed, but by the 3rd round at sectionals, it\u0026rsquo;s time to say goodbye to Mickey Mouse Frisbee and work yourself into a mental lather; and if you\u0026rsquo;re on a team that demands up-calls and a vocal sideline, then even better for you. Obviously it\u0026rsquo;s more difficult when defending the spread, but if you bide your time and sit on a team\u0026rsquo;s offense long enough and other defenders are digging in, you figure the O out and sometimes you get the grail, other times you see yourself in its reflection.\nHard to believe it\u0026rsquo;s almost been ten years, but my wife\u0026rsquo;s block vs RFBF in the \u0026lsquo;99 Mixed finals is the best layout block I\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen. The block earned her a concussion and the Llama a trip to Germany [and recently I read where someone said Mixed is for pansies]. A deep shot was sent to the girl she was guarding but Matt Hull leaped a got a finger on the disc, deflecting its course and Amy was able to come back under, layout and knock it down, simultaneously taking a knee to the back of the head and getting knocked the hell out.\nOn a lighter note, at Fools one year, I saw KD, after shot-gunning not one but two beers during a time-out, get a layout block on a dump pass that was thrown by the guy he was marking. The pass couldn\u0026rsquo;t have gone two yards before he blocked it. It was pretty sweet.\n"

  "issue": "019",
  "content": "The skill I\u0026rsquo;ve used most and tried to teach my players more than any other part of getting a layout block (aside from the obvious WANTING IT BAD part) is the footwork required to get a layout block. The obvious problem about getting a layout D is that you are trying to get to something that is being blocked by your offense\u0026rsquo;s body. I think getting a layout D without getting called for a foul/hurting anyone is huge.\nSo how do you do it? Think about your footwork—it\u0026rsquo;s all about angles. In soccer, the goalkeeper thinks about closing down the angles—as the person with the ball gets closer to her in a breakaway, she does not want to take steps backwards because that just opens up more of the goal to the shooter. Instead she takes steps toward the dribbler to close down the angles. I think about angles similar to these when preparing to get a layout D.\nImagine a situation in which you are a defender trailing your offense by a step on an in-cut on a diagonal toward the sideline. This is a very common occurrence, especially if the offense is playing a vertical stack offense. If you are able to make up two steps on that offense, you can get a layout D. Here\u0026rsquo;s how:\nSecond to last step on a diagonal to the inside of your offense (parallel to the sideline) Last step forward into your layout lane (parallel to the offense\u0026rsquo;s running path) Get the layout D The beauty of this is that the thrower doesn\u0026rsquo;t see you as a threat so they will throw this throw. You also can continue in your same speed instead of slowing down to get around someone and they often don\u0026rsquo;t feel you since you are taking an inside lane a step away from where they are running. This works particularly well for people who get layout Ds with speed (doing this footwork fast) or tall people, like me, who can gain a good deal of ground with the layout (getting into the lane so as not to dive into the receiver).\n"

  "title": "How To Get A Layout Block",
  "author": "Al Nichols",
  "issue": "019",
  "content": "In the perfect defensive scenario, no one ever has to get a layout block. The marker does a great job of taking away part of the field and preventing hucks. Lane cutter defenders deny any open space to downfield receivers and when the count is getting higher, the dump defender stuffs the reset option. The thrower is left with nothing and quietly puts down the disc after hearing the word ten. How often does that happen?\nI think most teams and their defensive players are not attempting to get a block on any given point but rather trying to prevent their opponents from getting open enough for a high percentage pass. Relatively easy to do against opponents who struggle to throw it long or to break the mark but increasingly difficult with better throwers and receivers. Against stronger throwers and receivers the defender is forced to position themselves closer to their opponent and as a result you often find yourself chasing someone as opposed to dictating to them where they can go. Most layout blocks come about from this position, where receiver is in full flight to an open space, a step or two ahead of their defender, and the only defensive play left after the disc is up is a layout bid. I\u0026rsquo;ve always found that there are three parts to making the play: put yourself in position, seize the opportunity and a small mistake from the offensive players.\nPositon\nThe reality for most defenders is that you have to make a wide variety of positional choices throughout a point, slightly altering these choices depending on the team defensive strategy of the point, where the disc is on the field, what the count is, your direct opponents strengths and weaknesses, weather conditions and if you have time to check it out, the throwing abilities of the person with the disc. But most of the time, in a man defensive scenario, I\u0026rsquo;ve always lined up about a step on the open side of the field and a step closer to the disc. If your receiver goes long or to the break side of the field they\u0026rsquo;re already a little open without even having to get you moving and you find yourself already chasing behind the receiver. Though these passes are slightly higher risk, against good throwers the defender has to bite on these cuts and try to stay as close as possible, so when a receiver cuts back to the open side you will still often find yourself chasing a receiver into the open side coming back to the disc even though your initial position was to deny that particular cut. Defenders often find themselves chasing receivers, offense dictating to the d, where the action is going to take place. Fortunately, if you going to get a block against a good thrower they usually have to see the receiver break open or the throw doesn\u0026rsquo;t go up. But to get the block you need to have that opening be as small as possible. Too close and the throw doesn\u0026rsquo;t go up, but hey great d. Too far behind and you\u0026rsquo;ll never make a play, just get ready to start marking. But about one step off the pace and you\u0026rsquo;re in position to maybe make a play.\nOpportunity\nWhenever I\u0026rsquo;ve been in the zone defensively and we\u0026rsquo;re playing a lot of man d, I am able to put myself in the defensive position of about a step behind my receiver consistently all game. And the moment we break into open space I\u0026rsquo;m already hoping for a throw with every intention of laying out and making the d. It is already in my mind. The timing of a layout block is critical and if you\u0026rsquo;re not ready to dive it\u0026rsquo;s probably too late. Almost all high-level- experienced players will lay out to catch the disc on O. The disc is right in front of you, the expectation of everyone on the field and sidelines is that you will at least try a layout if it is necessary. On D there\u0026rsquo;s no guarantee that the throw will even go up, that if it does you will necessarily have a shot at the disc but you have to assume that there\u0026rsquo;s going to be an opportunity. You\u0026rsquo;re never going to get it by going around the person behind them, so you have to figure out when and where you\u0026rsquo;re going to go inside his trailing shoulder, without making contact. These are the two major steps in seizing the opportunity: be ready and willing, and find an angle on the inside the receiver between him and the disc.\nThe Mistake(s)\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re way faster than your opponent then when the throw goes up, blow by your receiver and lay out or just catch it. For most players speed is fairly even.\nTo get the block, no matter how well positioned and how ready to lay out you still need a mistake.\nMistake#1\nIf a thrower reads his receiver\u0026rsquo;s position and speed relative to the defender and throws it perfectly out in front of their teammate to run onto with arms extended, the defender has no play. Get ready to mark. But if they throw it so the disc is going to arrive right into the receiver\u0026rsquo;s body, maybe you\u0026rsquo;ve got a chance. Being only one step behind and launching with arm fully extended should make up the gap and give you a chance to catch or tip the incoming disc. (I\u0026rsquo;ve always favoured launching and landing on my side for both comfort and efficacy because reaching with one arm will give you an extra few inches that could be key. I think it\u0026rsquo;s also more likely to avoid contact.)\nMistake#2\nEven if the thrower misses his angle by enough of a margin to give you a chance for a dive block, a smart receiver can change his angle to protect the disc. Instead of continuing to run at the angle he initiated, when the receiver sees the disc is going to be a little behind him or at his body, they should make a more direct line back to the thrower to protect the disc. This cuts off the defender\u0026rsquo;s angle and forces them to not lay out or if they do it\u0026rsquo;s almost impossible to avoid contact. Fortunately, a lot of receivers think they are more open then they are and will continue on their initial line. Run softly.\n"

  "author": "Jeff Eastham-Anderson",
  "issue": "019",
  "content": "Two key factors of getting a block are:\nBeing able to recognize mistakes by the offense Being in a good position to capitalize upon them Being faster than the person you\u0026rsquo;re guarding helps, but paying attention to these two aspects will help your team defensively.\nWhen it comes to positioning, as a defender I rarely bait throws in anticipation of a layout block, especially when it comes to cuts that are close to the disc. There is so little time to react, that my defensive goal is to deny the throw. It just happens that the position to deny those kinds of throws (even with or trailing the offensive player slightly, on the side closest to the thrower), also allows for the occasional layout attempt. If you are directly behind, or on the wrong side of the receiver, layout bids become more difficult, and can be very dangerous to everyone involved.\nRecognizing when the offense makes a mistake is the other key factor that determines whether or not you should make a layout attempt. For the majority of layout blocks I get, I knew when and where the disc was going to be thrown at the same time as, or earlier than, the receiver. Being able to look directly at the thrower, and keep the receiver in my peripheral vision gives me equal footing when it comes to making a play on the disc. Alternatively, if the receiver is making a one dimensional cut (i.e. the disc will be thrown to them at point X, or not all), this also lets me get into a good defensive position, and ready to make a bid.\nOnce the disc is in the air and I\u0026rsquo;ve decided I\u0026rsquo;m going attempt a block, if my positioning is good I can choose the best line to take to get to the disc without having to worry about what the receiver is doing. Whatever line the receiver chooses, the defender has a bit of an advantage here as they do not have to actually catch the disc. The slightest tip with a finger, or the mere presence of your body, is sometimes good enough. The only real insight I have on execution is that I try to drive off of the last step I take, just as I would if I was jumping in the air. Just because you\u0026rsquo;re running as fast as you can doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you should stop running and fall forward in the hope of getting a block.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not really sure how you learn the body motions to successfully make a block. Certainly there is timing involved, and landing in a controlled manner is a plus. A high-jump mat, or sand pit would reduce the wear and tear, but at some point you\u0026rsquo;re going to have to graduate to the hard stuff. As I mentioned above, drive off the last step you take. The primary impact should be taken by your abdomen hitting the ground as flatly as possible. After every practice attempt, get up as quickly as possible and set an imaginary mark. Not every bid is successful, and you will have set the mark if you miss.\n"

But when teams are executing well, coming up with a piece is tough. Don\u0026rsquo;t over-commit to laying out or you will end up getting burned on jukes and lying on the ground as the person you are supposed to cover has a free throw.\nWhich is to say that layout\u0026rsquo;s, like all blocks, come from team defense. If everyone is always going for a layout block (like everyone heaving up three- pointers) each player might look good once and a while, but mostly you will have a bunch of teammates playing as individual, not applying pressure as a team.\nSo don\u0026rsquo;t just count on your best players to get blocks for you. Your top defenders have to cover top O players and O has the advantage. Great defenders play well within a team concept—forcing deep, forcing out, whatever—and set up their layout blocks within that concept. They know that most offensive players have a few pet moves. If you can identify them, you have a better chance of getting a block. But players today are too athletic to bait. Let your team bring pressure; you make the play when it comes your way. Unless it\u0026rsquo;s summer league, your block should be the play everyone celebrates because they all helped make it happen—even if you get the glory.\n"

  "issue": "019",
  "content": "Like all things holy, the more you try to explain it with words, the farther you get from its essence\u0026hellip;\nLook: If you are on the field and thinking about getting a layout block, you\u0026rsquo;re likely not playing good defense. I don\u0026rsquo;t think there is a recipe for getting a layout block . I suppose you could practice, and I have seen people working on their diving and landing techniques. But it also requires a tremendous amount of luck.\nFirst, the thrower has to make a decision that throwing to your man is the best option. This point sounds obvious, but it\u0026rsquo;s important to recognize. It means that for whatever reason, the throw either yields a big reward compared to the risk of turnover, or the thrower miscalculates and thinks the receiver is more open than she is. Let\u0026rsquo;s say you are the best defender on the team and consistently smother whoever you are guarding. You will end up with no layout blocks if the throwers always look off your man. How many layout blocks you get should never be the barometer of the quality of your defense.\nSecond, the thrower has to make a bad throw. Perhaps the throw is a little too far on the inside, or floated a little too long. Whatever happened, you had the time to hurl yourself at it and get a piece. But if you blocked the throw, it should have never been thrown or it should have been thrown better. Good throwers and cutters know this. If you are thinking \u0026ldquo;layout block\u0026rdquo; and baiting a throw, they will make you pay by either putting the disc out to space where you can\u0026rsquo;t get it or throwing a pump fake and hitting your man going the other way.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s my advice for getting layout blocks, both for individuals and for entire teams. Play hard-nosed, take-no-prisoners defense. Follow the guidelines for effective D that have been enumerated many other times throughout this blog and elsewhere (dictate, triangulate, limit the cushion, use your body, etc.). Get in your man\u0026rsquo;s shorts and deny the disc, beating her to every spot. And then, when the thrower does make a mistake (and even the best will on occasion), you\u0026rsquo;ll know what to do.\n"

  "issue": "019",
  "content": "I\u0026rsquo;m frequently torn between the value of a layout block versus just shutting your guy down to the point that he\u0026rsquo;s not thrown to. Layout blocks, at least at the elite level, are typically the result of a bad decision or throw by the thrower, because it is very tough to get around elite receivers, and you\u0026rsquo;re generally just not going to make up enough ground to go from a guy being open to you blocking him unless the throw is in a bad spot or the receiver does a terrible job of sealing you. That being said, I think there is definitely an art to putting yourself in this position so that when the opportunity comes you can take advantage.\nThe primary factor is desire. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s the desire to keep your guy from getting it, to get the disc or win the glory of making that play, something has to be ticking in the defender\u0026rsquo;s head that will make him hurl his body at the disc. Learning the game in California we would occasionally work out and play on the beach where the potential for injury dramatically decreases and you start to think that maybe that\u0026rsquo;s possible on grass too. However, despite training and practice, at some level the layout block is an uncontrolled action with the prime motivation to get the disc. The mind just has stay out of the way and let the body do its thing.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve seen a lot of great blocks in big games, many of them for or against the team I was playing on, which can bias me. However, one that I saw early in my career, at my first nationals, is one of the few I remember that didn\u0026rsquo;t involve my team. It was Boston DoG, and I believe it was their epic semifinal of 1997 against Ring of Fire. Boston pulls during their epic comeback (they were down like 7-1 to start the game) and one of the markers in their clam/zone is sprinting down and the first pass is about to get thrown right by him. As he\u0026rsquo;s sprinting he somehow launches his body at a nearly right-angle to his left and about chest high. I actually cant even remember if he got the block, but I know it was a super-human effort for a pass that, while it was his responsibility, wasn\u0026rsquo;t really to his man. As he came do the ground he didn\u0026rsquo;t get up and the word was that he tore his ACL, or something in his knee. Boston went on to win that semifinal, and ultimately take down Sockeye in the final.\n"

  "content": "Zone O is like a game of chess- you spend a while moving your pieces around the board, not making much apparent headway, trying to find the weakness in the other team\u0026rsquo;s defense, and then suddenly you see your opportunity to capture their queen and it\u0026rsquo;s off to the races! Zone O also often showcases the triumph of craftiness over athleticism. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to be faster or taller or quicker than the other team- you just need to be skilled with the disc, disciplined, and know how to take advantage of the opportunities that present themselves.\nHandlers in a zone need to be quick and have good breakmark throws- or at least have a very quick release so that they get rid of the disc before the mark can adjust. They don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily need to have great hucks, since it\u0026rsquo;s rare that your hucking opportunities will come from behind the cup. They do need to have great chemistry and experience working together, so they can advance the disc quickly.\nMany teams have begun implementing a 2 handler zone O. The idea behind having 2 handlers is that you\u0026rsquo;re more likely to have a numbers mismatch downfield (since most zone D\u0026rsquo;s have at least 3 people in the cup). With 2 handlers behind the cup, your options are to either swing the disc around to a wing (where the wing is acting like a more traditional 3rd handler), or try to advance the disc through the cup. One way of getting through the cup is to have a handler \u0026ldquo;crash\u0026rdquo; the cup (run up into the cup and catch the disc inside the cup, preferably right in front of one of the other cup members). If the handler catches the disc in this position, it is easier to throw through the cup since the shortened distance between the thrower and the cup means there\u0026rsquo;s less time and range for the cup to be able to intercept those throws.\nOnce your handlers are able to reliably get the disc through the cup, the next step is to make sure they have open targets to hit in the small window of time they might have to get their throw off. The key to this is the numbers mismatch. If you try to make sure that you arrange your upfield players in such a way as to have a numbers mismatch in the \u0026ldquo;layer\u0026rdquo; of players directly behind the cup, you will increase your chances of being able to capitalize on that numbers mismatch (for example, by having 2 poppers being guarded by 1 short deep).\nNow if you have handlers that can get the disc through the cup and receivers that are open behind the cup, the next step is to capitalize on having broken the zone: keep the disc moving so that the cup can\u0026rsquo;t re-form around you (give- and-go\u0026rsquo;s, quick short passes), and look for long strikes. This is where your huckers come in- if you can afford to put a long thrower in the popper position, they\u0026rsquo;ll be in a much better position to get a long throw off since they won\u0026rsquo;t have a cup around them. Typically you\u0026rsquo;ll find that the deep strikes are more effective from the wings than from the deep position, since the deep is often already being guarded by the defensive deep-deep. The offensive deep is actually in a great position to cut in for a popper, since the defensive deep-deep is unlikely to follow them in (and if they do, well, there go the wings\u0026hellip;!).\nFor a zone offense to be effective, the disc must be kept moving. Any stagnation allows the defense to set up, take stock of where the threats are, and regain the advantage. If you keep the disc moving, even if it\u0026rsquo;s just with short easy throws, you will prevent the defense from being able to adapt quickly enough and will eventually find the holes in their formation.\n"

  "title": "Adjustments & Positioning",
  "author": "Jeff Eastham-Anderson",
  "issue": "018",
  "content": "The easiest way to simulate bad-weather conditions in a drill or a game is to simply tell your players to not throw the throws you can\u0026rsquo;t realistically complete in those conditions. The idea is to gain confidence in beating a zone with flat, crisp, high percentage throws. And if for some reason they decide to throw a cross-field hammer, or 10 yard push pass, stop the drill and reset, or just call it a turnover and continue playing from there. This will help with throw selection, but executing a throw in inclement weather requires practice in those conditions.\nIn an ideal situation, I prefer a two-handler set that works together to create windows of opportunity to move the disc upfield. Two main options in this set are to go over the cup, or through the cup. A third option that is less frequently utilized option with two handlers is to go around the cup.\nAny time an offensive set is not working, the main responsibility to recognize this lies with the handlers. They should be in a position to see the entire field, and also to realize when the go-to look has been shut down five times in a row. If your zone offense is built around swinging the disc from one sideline to the other, and it gets stopped in the middle, that handler stuck with the disc is probably the person that will realize this first. At that point they can adjust their own spacing, or that of a teammate. If that fails to produce results, a timeout wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a bad call.\nDeep players in a zone offense are in a pretty unique position. If they do their job well, they rarely touch the disc, but are able to create space for the other players to gain yardage. If they don\u0026rsquo;t do their job well by crowding closer to the disc, they\u0026rsquo;ll end up touching the disc more. However, the offense will have a harder time overall moving the disc as the defense will be able to move in with the deep. Ideally, a deep player will touch the disc zero times or once on any offensive sequence, and will totally occupy one person\u0026rsquo;s capacity (or more) to defend. Put another way, the offense is able to score with short, easy throws, because the deep defender is positioned so that no single defender is able to help defend other offensive players.\nThe easiest way I know of to deal with a trap zone is to simply not throw it to somebody on the sideline. If you have a zone offense that depends on moving the disc across the field to get around the cup, think about learning another offensive set. If you must move the disc to a sideline, you want to impress upon the players on that sideline that their job is not to hold the disc, but to hit the first open player they see, even if that person just threw them the disc. Furthermore, everybody else on the field needs to provide a sideline thrower with immediate targets. The longer you hold the disc, the longer a defense can recognize and lock down on the available targets.\n"

  "issue": "018",
  "content": "Zone offense is very difficult to simulate in practice. The skills necessary for zone are often quite different than for man (offense and defense). For zone O, you need to practice vision, patience and confidence which are quite difficult to simulate. For the most part, we usually teach zone O by drawing it up on a white board, going over it on the field and then doing LOTS of 5/10-pulls sometimes stopping the point to reposition people, especially in the early parts of the year. Handlers can simulate zone offense by playing against different types of partial defenses (3-person or 4-person cups, box and 1, etc.) in small sided games where they just try to advance the disc. Poppers can be added to increase the reality factor in these small-sided games (we often play 5 on 3 or 4).\nI prefer having 2 handlers attack 4-person cups and 3 attack 3-person cups. This is not to say that they can\u0026rsquo;t both work for both defenses, but 2 handlers can easily attack the middle (where the weakness is in 4-person cups) and 3 can more easily and quickly swing to attack the sides which tend to be weaker in 3-person cups. Handlers and poppers should be the first to realize what type of zone is being played and can thus most easily adjust to the formation.\nDeeps in zone offense tend to hang out and wait for things to happen around them. To a certain extent this is true—they should never just move around blindly. However, deep movement can not only open throws to these deep cutters, but can make poppers\u0026rsquo; lives much easier by drawing short-deep and deep-deep defenders away from their space. Deep cutters should try to make the deep deep choose between them by staying in or out and staying left or right. They should definitely switch based on where the disc is and make real cuts but they should never be on the same side of the field or both be under/deep.\n"

  "title": "Personal Fundamentals Of Zone O",
  "author": "Ben Van Heuvelen",
  "issue": "018",
  "content": "I\u0026rsquo;ll write here about the fundamentals of good zone O. These will, I hope, reveal some underlying principles that any team can apply to its specific strategy/terminology, and to specific situations (e.g., how to deal with a sideline trip). I\u0026rsquo;ll rely on my co-contributors to address those specifics in detail, and read with interest!\nSo, getting down to basics\u0026hellip;\nTo figure out how our zone offense should work, we should think about what makes good zone defense successful. Most zone defenses have two main goals. First, they want to make our offense throw lots of passes. (If we\u0026rsquo;re forced to throw 100 passes with a 99% completion rate, that equals a turnover.) Most zone defense do this by leaving certain easy passes to the backfield or sideline uncovered, and pressuring the middle of the field with extra defenders. Second, the defense wants to put itself in position to make a play if and when we try something difficult (a hammer, huck, or needle-threading pass through the cup). *\nThe key to beating most zone defenses, then, is to create openings in the middle of the field by getting the defense out of position, and then to exploit each opening as much as possible. How do we make that happen? A few principles:\n1. Philosophy. We do NOT want to \u0026ldquo;dump-swing all day.\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s exactly what the defense wants. If/when we dump-swing, the purpose is to create and exploit openings in the middle of the field. Zone O should not be \u0026ldquo;chilly.\u0026rdquo; It should be chracterized by two maxims. First, from John Wooden: \u0026ldquo;Be quick, but don\u0026rsquo;t hurry.\u0026rdquo; Second: Attack the middle, attack the middle, attack the middle.\n2. Setup. Different teams will use different terminology and organize their handlers differently, but the best offenses have fewer players at the line of scrimmage than the defense. Defenses usually have 3-4 defenders within 10 yards of scrimmage. The most efficient offenses have 2 (including thrower), maybe 3 (in a trap situation) \u0026ndash; just enough handlers to make sure we reset the stall count and change the side-to-side positioning of the disc. This gives us more players downfield, which lets us do two important things. First, we spread the defense: we are more likely to create holes in the middle if our downfield O players outnumber the downfield D, and if they are spreading the field deep and wide. Second: once we create a hole in the middle, we have a better chance of turning a fast break if the O outnumbers the D.\n3. Handler attack. In efficient zone offenses, it\u0026rsquo;s rarely the handlers who gain the yards. The purpose of handler attack is to create yardage-gaining situations (e.g., fast breaks) for the downfield players. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen three basic methods of handler attack, which different teams combine in different proportions. The most familiar (and, in my opinion, least reliable) is the \u0026ldquo;dump-swing.\u0026rdquo; The other two are the \u0026ldquo;chisel\u0026rdquo; and the overhead. For the sake of example, let\u0026rsquo;s say we\u0026rsquo;re playing against a 3-person cup zone\u0026hellip;\na. With the \u0026ldquo;chisel,\u0026rdquo; a handler, usually set up in the backfield, cuts towards the middle-middle and receives a short flip pass. His momentum carries him right up to the middle-middle, at which point he has only one defender (rather than an entire cup) between him and the middle of the field. A well timed cut (or combination of cuts) from the popper(s), and the handler is only a pivot away from delivering the disc beyond the cup, into the middle of the field.\nb. With the overhead, a handler delivers a hammer, blade, or scoober to a space beyond the cup. High-percentage overhead passes are thrown to a space in front of the intended receiver, when his closest defender is behind him. (As a hammer receiver, I want to be stepping towards the disc, never backpedaling or standing still.) Offenses generate opportunities for high-percentage overheads both (a) by attacking the middle effectively \u0026ldquo;on the ground,\u0026rdquo; (e.g., by chiseling) thereby drawing the defense close to the disc, and (b) by keeping the field spread deep and wide with offensive players even after the defense clamps. This last point is key: when the defense collapses on the disc, it becomes even more important to spread your O players.\n4. Downfield attack. Regardless of your specific strategy, there are three main responsibilities that your downfield O players have to fulfill. a. Spread deep. b. Spread wide. c. Attack the middle. Three general principles should govern downfield O players in almost any zone O:\na. Set up for a cut when the disc is still, cut when the disc is moving. Defensive holes open when the disc moves and the defense is repositioning. This is when you\u0026rsquo;re going to get open. In downfield zone O, you are rarely cutting for the person with the disc. You should be cutting for your thrower before s/he receives the disc.\nb. 95% of good hucks in zone O happen off of swings. When the disc swings, deep spreaders should cut deep, ideally from the opposite side of the field. Otherwise, deep spreaders should threaten deep space just enough to get open for a continuation pass, once the disc breaks into the middle.\nc. Once the disc breaks past the first layer of defense, find the best angle to cut TOWARDS the disc. Even if you\u0026rsquo;re a deep, take a few hard steps away, then come underneath. (The deepest defender will give up the underneath cut 90% of the time.) If the disc breaks into the middle of the field, then it\u0026rsquo;s the middle we should attack, from as many angles as possible.\n* A third goal of good zone defenses is to trick you into thinking something is open, and then suddenly take it away when you\u0026rsquo;ve already made a fateful choice. This is an important thing to be aware of. (For example, it highlights the importance of throwing fakes, which can help reveal the defense\u0026rsquo;s tricks.) But it doesn\u0026rsquo;t affect the main principles of zone O setup.\n"

  "content": "A zone defense is usually designed to only give the offense options that do not play to their strengths (i.e. working it laterally, taking away speed, or breaking the mark into the wind). I have been on women\u0026rsquo;s teams before that have had a very difficult time with the four person cup in a moderately windy (cross wind) situation. Typically, the defense would trap the downwind sideline making it difficult for the thrower to break the cup not only because there are four big defensive players near them, but also because there is a wind in their face. Therefore, it was advantageous for us to practice this particular situation whenever there was a strong cross wind. Each player would get the disc on the sideline, we would place a four person cup on that person, and they would get five chances to break the cup successfully. Also, since most four person cups double team (either intentionally or unintentionally), we would deliberately practice being double teamed when trapped on that sideline. If it is a four person, two main handlers with two wings would be ideal but it can be accomplished with a three person formation as well.\nThe Piedmont of North Carolina is fairly mild as far as wind goes. I began playing ultimate in the midwest and I swear I was much less intimidated by the wind when I lived in Michigan playing club women\u0026rsquo;s ultimate than I was after a couple of years of living in NC. It is not just that your team can not practice in the wind, but you do not throw in the wind, you do not play league in the wind, you do not play pickup in the wind. So much lost practice time in the wind. To make up for it, we have routinely had beach weekends hoping for strong winds to practice in and there has even been talk about going to Sarasota at another time of the year besides the end of Oct to get more experience in less than ideal weather conditions. Finally, it is important to emphasize throwing, throwing a lot, and throwing with a lot of spin no matter what the conditions are. Therefore, even though there may be a 5 mph wind in NC, one can not get lazy with their throws and begin throwing with no spin, and no legs. You must pretend there is a strong wind at all times.\nHow should we attack the zone? Try and do exactly what the zone d does not want you to do. BREAK THE CUP. This can be done numerous ways.\nPoppers could place themselves in good positions for handlers to hit them through the cup. Handlers could move it quickly side to side and then hit wings/popper to gain yardage. Handlers could move it side to side gaining yards with each swing. The cut will have to pay less attention to those sideline handlers getting yardage if the poppers remain a threat. Handlers going over the cup using an arsenal of throws to wings and poppers. Once the disc is past the cup, do not let the cup catch up. It is the wings and poppers\u0026rsquo; responsibility to make sure they are making real cuts for each other and really attempt to keep the disc moving. Deep players, or wings, generally have the hardest time finding a way to be effective out there in the zone O. In a four person cup situation, one way the deeps can be effective is to have one of them completely drag the other team\u0026rsquo;s deep defender out of the play. Now, you have 6 on 6 with four of those six around one of your players. If that one player significantly breaks the cup it is a two on five situation. Another way the deeps can be effective is by working together as a pulley system. As one goes in, the other can pull out and make a legit deep cut. As the other goes in, the one that just went deep can come in for a huge gainer.\nHow do you deal with a trap zone? What kind of players should you put in positions (like the downwind wing) that are likely to be trapped? As mentioned earlier, this needs to be practiced. If the disc gets to the trap sideline, you have a handful of options as that person with the disc.\nBreak the mark backwards for the dump. The dump must immediately swing it to keep it off that sideline. Have your other handler set up to the right or left of the middle-middle in the cup. Use your fakes and pivots like you are going to hit the behind dump, but then hit your swing handler almost completely lateral. Use your fakes and pivots to hit a popper. A popper can also provide a decoy cut or crash to make it easier for you to hit either handler mentioned in #1 or #2. Have the handler that is lined up somewhat behind you come through and crash the cup. From there you would either use that cut as a decoy and either hit handler #2 through a hole created by handler #1 or hit a popper through the same hole. Or, you could give a quick shovel pass to that crashing handler. Now, that handler has the disc very close to the cup. The cup is not in formation anymore as they are no where close to 10 feet away from the person with the disc. It becomes much easier for the handler to go through the cup here. Go over the top. Easiest way, but maybe the most difficult way once some wind has been thrown into the equation. If the disc gets trapped on the sideline with a non handler (i.e. wing), that wing must not sit and hold the disc waiting for the cup to form perfectly around them. It is the popper\u0026rsquo;s responsibility to formulate a continue cut which, if hit, will put the disc more in the center of the field. It is the wing\u0026rsquo;s responsibility to catch the disc and IMMEDIATELY look to the center of the field, NOT DOWN THE LINE, for this continuation cut. If this cut is not hit, and the wing gets trapped on the sideline, more times than not, it is best to go with option #4 above. If that does not work, hopefully the practice the wing got at breaking the cup at practice was enough to successfully get it out of there.\n"

  "issue": "018",
  "content": "There are a number of ways to try to approximate the weather approximations that a zone offense will face. Some of these strengthen the defense such as adding an 8th player to the d or shortening the stall count while others might hamper the offense no overheads or huck limits.\nThere is really no good way to approximate inclement weather for the offense, but at some point you can handcuff the offense enough that when they face a weather situation with standard playing conditions they will feel that things are easy, and really that is the goal.\nThere is no right answer for the correct approach to playing zone offense, but some are better than others. The Condors radically changed their zone offense after losing to DoG in the finals of nationals in 1998, basically borrowing whatever they gleaned from playing against DoG that year. The real story is deciding how your team can realistically attack a zone. Do you have consistent handlers who can swing the disc to tire the other team out? Do you have flashy handlers who can beat a zone by going over the top? Do you have runners who can keep moving around to stretch the defense and create holes? Depending on the answers to these questions, the optimal offense may be different for your team. The real key is to get players to know what their role is. Do you want your wings/poppers running around getting into the cup and pulling and prodding at the defense, or do you want them to be stationary and waiting until they are in a free space to receive the disc? Similarly, should your deeps be setting up for a deep cut, or should they be trying to pull the deep defender out of the play, or should two deeps be trying to split the deep defender? These questions can be answered through some trial and error, but eventually the team should be aware of what the goals of the offense are, such as \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rsquo;re going to swing until Bob can uncork a huck\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;when it gets to the line, we want the deep flashing in\u0026rdquo;, etc.\nRecognizing that the opponent is running zone is critical to getting a successful start to the point. Ideally the spatial distribution of skill on your team will look fairly similar whether the opponent is running zone or man. What this means is that your deeps in zone, are also likely the people who are looking to cut deep off the pull, while your handlers are around the disc in either case. Sometimes a clever zone offense doesnt need to announce the other teams defense to fall into the proper spacing, and even making some man cuts might free up space for other players to exploit in the zone. At some point the offense should settle into its zone offense, but I always preferred to try to get the man play off against a zone defense. If you can get the disc past an unorganized cup, there might be an easy chance to exploit the defense.\nFinally, I think it is important to put your most composed handler on the downwind side to be there for the trap. This may not necessarily be your best thrower, but rather the person that will create a sense of calm when in that situation. Freaked-out throwers tend to draw everyone closer to them, which might not be most beneficial to the offense. Rather, having a composed thrower will keep the offense in its form so that the thrower will have the best opportunities to complete things, the offense will maintain its plan of attack because the positioning is stable, and finally to give everyone else confidence that the zone defense can be beaten by sticking to the plan.\n"

  "issue": "018",
  "content": "Up through the 90s, teams played a mix of two- and three-handler sets, but all zone offenses emphasized swinging the disc and attacking the far side of the field against a zone on the run. Then, the Condors, led by handlers James Studarus, Steve Dugan and Taro Ramberg began to run something fundamentally different. This was a two-handler set that didn\u0026rsquo;t swing and attacked a stagnant zone. Their philosophy was that no matter how many defenders you pulled in, you weren\u0026rsquo;t going to be able to stop two of them from throwing it back and forth to each other on little two to five yard passes. Then sooner or later, you\u0026rsquo;d make a mistake and they\u0026rsquo;d go through or over your cup and have a five-on-four fast break. That\u0026rsquo;s when they\u0026rsquo;d chew you for big yards.\nLook around ultimate today and you can see the signs of this offense everywhere. Handlers who crash the cup? Yep. Teams throwing through and over the cup consistently? Yep. Teams breaking the cup and then stringing four or five passes together rapidly? Yep. Not having to listen to teams exhort each other to \u0026ldquo;Swing the disc\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Tire them out?\u0026rdquo; Yep.\nWhat are the requirements for running this offense? You need are two savvy, creative handlers who can respond to a variety of situations and have the skills to break a cup down. These skills don\u0026rsquo;t (and won\u0026rsquo;t) look the same for any two players. Some players might throw lots of little cute throws like lefties or scoobers (they do work in the wind), while other players might wield a big hammer or a nasty set of inside outs. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter so much what it is as long as they have something. You also need a team that can play quick once the zone has been broken. They physical skill of quick catch and release is a must and there are lots of fun drills for this. The mental skill of reading the defense is also a requirement. I like a four-on-three or three- on-two fast break drill to develop this vision and reinforce the physical skills. Good luck!\n"

  "title": "The Jailbreak",
  "author": "Charlie Reznikoff",
  "issue": "018",
  "content": "For most zones, the vulnerable spot is ten yards behind the cup (or front wall). To get there you can go through the cup, over the cup, or around the cup. Through and over involve risk. Around requires patience and planned cuts. Ideally after the swing, before the cup is reset, the handler has two cutters available for the next throw, one a continuation to the line and the other a throw to the middle. Most zones will stop the continuation, force you to throw back to the middle, and hope the cup will get there to stop or defend that throw. As the cup tires, the window for throws to the middle opens. Once the disc is behind the cup, that player (a popper) should have continuation cuts to the middle of the field. These come from the other popper or the wings. Any reasonable throw, even for a minimal gain, should be thrown. Each throw forces the scrambling defense to readjust yet again. The throw to the middle, and the resulting jailbreak, is the most desirable outcome of the swing, and the best way to beat a zone.\nIf offensive players hang out too deep, they will miss the continuation cut after the swing, and more importantly, they will miss the jailbreak. If these players stay nearer to the disc, they will draw the deep defender in and, when the jail break happens, a cutter can blow by the deep D for an easier huck.\nI would practice zone starting with a swing and with the cup out of position. Practice splitting the D after the swing and flooding the middle. This will help your offense learn to coordinate their jailbreaks and also teach the defense to recover after a swing.\n"

Handlers must do the same and adjust their throws.\nKeep moving. It\u0026rsquo;s easy for deeps and wings to start standing and watching. Even if your zone offense calls for you as the deep O threat to go to the back of the endzone, move around there.\nLet the deeps on D see you moving. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to sprint, but you can\u0026rsquo;t stand. Zone defenders want to keep track of what\u0026rsquo;s going on. Give them more to keep track of.\nNever throw to someone backpedaling and don\u0026rsquo;t turn your back to the play.

  "author": "Ryan Morgan",
  "issue": "018",
  "content": "My college team always seemed to be able to only field 5 good zone offense players. The last two players on the line were usually assigned to play the wing position—that is, the popper responsible for making cuts to the sideline when the handlers swung the disc around. As a result, I never really appreciated how important the wing position is to an effective zone offense until I started playing club. In fact, I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s a stretch to say that good wing players can do more to make a zone offense run smoothly than any other position.\nAll zone defenses are designed to make the offense throw a lot of completed passes. They do this by committing defenders to cutting lanes around the thrower. So in theory, when the handlers swing the disc quickly to the other side of the field there wont be enough defenders to cover the new cutting lanes. This is when a wing player with excellent timing can have the biggest impact. By this time, the wing should have set up a cut to the sideline for decent yardage. The wing, if open, should receive a pass from the thrower quite close to the sideline. If covered, the wing has succeeded in drawing one of the only defenders on that side of the field all the way to the sideline. This is important because there should now be a huge open throwing lane behind that defender which can be filled by someone else. No other zone offense position can do as much to open up cutting and throwing lanes.\nThe key to playing the wing position effectively is timing. When disc gets swung around the handler set to the off-side handler, he or she will only have one or two seconds to make an up-field throw before the zone defense adjusts. The wing must have already set up and made a strong cut to the sideline so when the handler turns upfield he or she sees either an open wing or a wide open throwing lane towards the middle of the field.\nA team that consistently gets these types of opportunities to move the disc upfield will have much more success against a zone defense.\n"

  "author": "Seth Wiggins",
  "issue": "017",
  "content": "I can\u0026rsquo;t really answer these questions. The right answers depend on too many factors, many of which can only be judged during your game. Variables such as individual\u0026rsquo;s athleticism, defensive abilities, your opponent\u0026rsquo;s strengths, current conditions, number of defenders available, ect, are all part of the equation.\nHaving an answer to these questions is hard, but judging the quality of your answer is even harder. At best it\u0026rsquo;s incredibly difficult to evaluate results based on your coaching input alone. Most of the time your defense will fail to get a block, and when it succeeds the question remains whether the offense would have otherwise thrown a turnover anyway. Further, in any competition based sport, your success is always (always, always) relative to your opponent\u0026rsquo;s performance. A great defensive effort might have been due to poor offensive play, and vice versa.\nSo is all defensive strategizing merely blowing hot air, no better than randomly choosing a given defense to try? Yes and no. You are gambling with whatever defense you choose, however you can improve your chances by thinking about your relative strengths and weaknesses, and how they relate to those of your opponent.\nTry this: imagine coaching a defense in a game against an offense where the defense never gets to play offense; their goal is to only get blocks. Your team cannot poach or switch. Fully unconstrained by stamina, both teams need only seven players. Each of the seven offensive players are uniform in their ability to handle, cut, and catch long throws. Likewise, your seven defenders are individually equal in their ability to mark and defend both longer and shorter cuts. However not all players are equal - but the difference between players is one unit, so the defense\u0026rsquo;s fourth best player, or D4, is three units better than D7, and O1 is six units better than O7. One last assumption: Offensive players have a two step advantage over the defender with their corresponding number so O3 beats D3 by two steps, every time.\nSo how do you match your defense up with the offense? The easiest answer is to match corresponding numbers, so O1 is guarded by D1, O2 by D2, and so on. This makes sense, as it minimizes the overall advantage that the offense has over the defense, for O1 will gain less against D1 than any other defender, O2 will beat D2 by less than anyone else save the already assigned O1, and so on. However given the last assumption where the offense has the advantage, everyone in this scenario is open - a big problem for any defense.\nWhat about the opposite - guarding O1 with D7, O2 with D6, O3 with D5, and so on? That would make life much harder for O\u0026rsquo;s 5-7, as they are now playing against the D\u0026rsquo;s best. This could be great strategy against a team that likes to use all of its players, for it will limit their options that otherwise they would depend on. However it also will leave O\u0026rsquo;s 1-3 with greater amounts of separation, which a team relies heavily on its top players will love to see.\nSome teams favor using their D\u0026rsquo;s 1-2 on O\u0026rsquo;s 3-4, shutting down the best O players they can, while minimizing losses elsewhere. Others focus on rotating their D\u0026rsquo;s 1-4 on Os 1 and 2, in order to give different challenges and levels of difficulty for their best opponents. Some use D\u0026rsquo;s 6 and 7 on O1 to prevent long throws, giving O1 open cuts back to the disc and trying to stop everyone else. There are teams who favor choosing one strategy and sticking with it the whole game/season, allowing them to specialize in their given roles, however this also allows their opponents to study and practice their response. Other teams forgo specializing particular roles and change their strategy every point. While this limits their defensive abilities, there is a large advantage in not allowing the offense to know what is coming.\nWhats the best strategy? Even in this sterile environment, no one knows. The definition of a successful defensive strategy is limiting the offense\u0026rsquo;s effectiveness more than any other strategy would, which often means getting beat repeatedly , and scored on often. Further, just because a given offense favors on approach, for example throwing only to their top players, does not mean, if stopped, they will be unable to use O\u0026rsquo;s 4-7. In fact, it might make them better. It\u0026rsquo;s difficult to both devise and evaluate any particular defensive strategy, but in doing so you can improve your odds in a very tough gamble. While you certainly will not know everything you might want, especially before you try a particular strategy, if you can think about how your strengths and weaknesses relate to your opponent\u0026rsquo;s, and devise a strategy based upon this information, your defense will be much better for it.\n"

  "content": "Just as with an offensive squad, each player on the defensive line has a few areas that he or she excels at. Some may be good at running down the long, streaking cuts, while other will be good at then tight, close-to-the-disc cuts. There may be another who has a very active mark that comes up with more point blocks than anyone else. And just as the offense trains players to fill certain roles, so should the defense train players to stop certain roles.\nWhen faced with a very good offensive player, you must first realize that stopping that player is going to be very hard. The amount of effort spent trying is not likely to produce a worthwhile result. Defense is about exposing and exploiting the other team\u0026rsquo;s weakest areas. Therefore, you must abandon the hope of shutting this player down, and simply reduce him to a less threatening player (i.e. not throwing or catching scores). You must cater your attack to when he does not have the disc.\nEvery player has a comfort zone. You can watch as they enter the mode where they know exactly what they are going to do next without even thinking about it. This can be the worst or best place for a defender to place their mark into. A smart, agile defender can allow their mark to enter the zone, only to take away their favorite option. Take the example of a player with a strong flick that loves to cut up the line. Once identified, a smart defender can allow the player to make that cut, but jump over and sit on the flick. The offender is caught off guard, and throws a shaky, off-balance backhand that can be picked off by another defender.\nHowever, it\u0026rsquo;s also possible that once in the zone, they know all the options well. Given the same offensive player traits as above, this one will actually make a very good backhand throw, doing just as much damage. A good defender is not going to allow the player into that comfort zone, or at least make it very difficult to enter. Every defender can take away something. So is this case, we give up everything but the up-line cut. The offender will still be a key player, but if we take away is favorite strength, it\u0026rsquo;s more likely that he will expose the team\u0026rsquo;s weakness.\nI like to appoint match-ups as soon as possible. This gives the defender a while to get used to his mark\u0026rsquo;s habits. Just as in poker, most players have tells. They will often be as subtle as a certain hip shimmy that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be noticeable to the average spectator, but any defender worth his salt will notice every aspect of when he gets beat. Those tells will become evident and the defender can play off them.\nSometimes, the mental adjustments cannot be made fast enough. This is evident to a coach when the same sequence of event happens with the same result. It\u0026rsquo;s at this time that you put a different defender on. Here is the key: you don\u0026rsquo;t put the original defender on someone else. Doing so will add new elements to what the defender is learning, and will only server to delay the process. After a point—two at the most—and a brief talk to make sure recognition is there, the defender is put back on. If he still can\u0026rsquo;t make the adjustments and it\u0026rsquo;s early in the game, then see if someone else can be a quick study. If it\u0026rsquo;s late in the game, it\u0026rsquo;s not likely you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to solve the problem with a new defender. There\u0026rsquo;s not the time for the new one to make it through the learning process. In this case, your game plan has failed, and your only hope is to flip to something involving team defense to make up the gap.\nWhen there is one standout defender, he should be marking a mid-level, role player type. One who tends to fly under the radar, but is still an integral part of disc movement. Baiting here is encouraged, since this player is trusted to get the disc, but will not do significant damage if the bait fails. If every other average defender is taking away the one that that leads to scoring on their marks, the chances of the offense\u0026rsquo;s weakness showing up increases. The idea is not to shut down the best offensive players. As long as they are not catching scores, there is opportunity whenever the disc is released from the players\u0026rsquo; hands. Then the object of the defense is to make those releases as unsure as possible. By doing things like making the windows smaller or forcing the thrower into a throw they\u0026rsquo;re not adept at, they are increasing their chances of getting a hand on the disc.\n"

  "content": "Defensive matchups can be a positive aspect of successfully implementing a defensive strategy, but they can also serve to be a limitation. There are certain instances where a defender just has another players number and as a team you would be foolish to not consider that, but if you let certain matchups become the focus of the defensive strategy it may prevent you from running the defenses that are most successful for the team. As a defensive captain, I have always tried to set the defensive philosophy and then let matchups occur within that strategy.\nIf a defender feels that he can shut a particular player down, then he\u0026rsquo;ll usually get a chance to try his hand, but if the player is demanding a matchup they better also feel the pressure to deliver some results. The teams I\u0026rsquo;ve played on have always set their own assignments on the line, so if a player makes a request for a matchup they usually get it. Frequently this will lead to the defender putting some extra pressure on themself to succeed, and hopefully get their full attention and effort into the matchup. The key is to balance this within the defensive team play and make sure that, on balance, the team has good matchups. In this way, I think the assignment of a matchup coming from the defensive player, rather than initiated from the coach/captain, gives the defender a chance to succeed because they feel the most responsibility for the outcome of their matchup.\nThe matchup for the best defender would really come from the style of the other team. If they have one big target that the offense likes to throw to, that would be an obvious choice for the best defender. However, if the team is a patient team that relies on resets around the disc, I would put the defender on a handler who the team relies on for resets. Again, putting the defender on a player that they are confident matching up with will most likely have the best results.\n"

  "content": "I have a fairly low tolerance for good defenders getting beat. On the other hand, I\u0026rsquo;m always telling my girls (until I\u0026rsquo;m blue in the face) that the offensive player always has an advantage because she always know where she\u0026rsquo;s going to cut, and the defensive player is always a step behind. That being said, I\u0026rsquo;m always going to put my best defender on the other team\u0026rsquo;s best offensive threat, unless there\u0026rsquo;s a reason that I don\u0026rsquo;t want that matchup—be it height, or speed, or whatever. In the college game, though, it\u0026rsquo;s a lot easier to make up for those disparities.\nRight now, I\u0026rsquo;m teaching my kids team D, which has been really frustrating for them, because they\u0026rsquo;re used to being focused on a single player for the entire point. I\u0026rsquo;m seeing the light bulbs gradually go on, though, and I\u0026rsquo;m going to have them use it at a tournament in about a month.\nFor this situation, I will let them get beat a few times before I try something else, because I want them to learn what they should be doing and what the field looks like if they\u0026rsquo;re doing it right vs. if they\u0026rsquo;re doing it wrong. I\u0026rsquo;m definitely harder on the ones who know what they\u0026rsquo;re doing, though, for that very reason. They know what they\u0026rsquo;re supposed to be doing right, and if they\u0026rsquo;re out of position, I\u0026rsquo;m going to ask them to tell me what they did wrong, and have them keep guarding the person who\u0026rsquo;s beating them until she\u0026rsquo;s shut down. Also with this team, I\u0026rsquo;m a lot more likely to mix around strong and not-as-strong defenders because I want the up-and-coming ones to cover a better player, anticipating that this will also make them better defenders.\nI think it superstar matchups depend on what kind of player the superstar defender is. I\u0026rsquo;ll use Danny (Quarrell, from Portland) as an example—he\u0026rsquo;s one of the best defenders, hands down, but you don\u0026rsquo;t really want him guarding Nord in the endzone (though he probably has ended up doing so at some point).\nI want him guarding BLW instead, because I want him to prevent one of the game\u0026rsquo;s best handlers from even getting the disc in the first place. And because the height matchup is a lot more favorable. On my college team, my best (smartest) defender is also \u0026ldquo;vertically challenged.\u0026rdquo; I will put her on the other team\u0026rsquo;s best handler and leave my taller, more athletic players to guard the deep threats, because there are fewer players in the college game who can put the disc wherever they want. I have more confidence that they can shut down a huck play by playing team D than I do that they can get a turnover by each putting blinders on and chasing a single player around the field.\n"

  "content": "Know your foe.\nThere are lots of ways you can get the most out of your defensive matchups and it starts with not only knowing your own players but also knowing your opponents. The more familiar you are with the opposing team\u0026rsquo;s offensive weapons ahead of time, the better you can prepare to counter them quickly and effectively. Furthermore, as important as it is to recognize primary play makers, it\u0026rsquo;s just as important to know how the rest of your roster compares overall to the other team\u0026rsquo;s personnel.\nWhen deciding what kind of matchup to assign your \u0026ldquo;best\u0026rdquo; defender, a defender\u0026rsquo;s physical strengths, which offensive position(s) s/he is most adept at defending, and the D-line\u0026rsquo;s competencies versus the opposition are all factors. Ask yourself:\nA. Does it make sense to put your best defender on a go-to player of similar skill and stature in hopes of containing him/her, throwing off the offensive flow, and then relying mainly on your other defenders to generate the D, or\nB. Is it better in the situation at hand to give your best defender a mismatch and have him/her bait and get a D while relying on the rest of your defenders to challenge the other primary play maker(s)?\nMaking these distinctions is difficult without at least an idea of what your competition brings to the field and how your whole team matches up to them. Otherwise it\u0026rsquo;s likely that you will waste time with trial and error and guesswork, which could make the difference between a win and a loss.\nTo sub or not to sub?\nWho you consider your \u0026ldquo;best\u0026rdquo; defender to be might be someone different from game to game depending on who the other team\u0026rsquo;s offensive weapons are and what they do. However, there are some basic principles that can be applied regardless of specifics.\n1. If it\u0026rsquo;s not broken don\u0026rsquo;t fix it.\nSometimes it\u0026rsquo;ll take a few points for a defender to get a feel for what an opponent\u0026rsquo;s go-to moves are and how to respond to them. Once that happens, if the defender continues to be effective and take away those looks, it would make sense to let that defender keep doing what s/he\u0026rsquo;s doing. A switch would mean that someone new might also need a few points to figure out what someone else already has and that might turn out to be a few points too many. With that being said\u0026hellip;\n2. If you\u0026rsquo;re worried about wear and tear or predictability, don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to rotate.\nThe two big problems with having the same matchup for a whole game are the risks of burning out your best defender and allowing the offense too much time to read the defense and adjust. To avoid these situations, having 1-2 acceptable backups to switch off can be a good strategy. This way, you give your primary defender an occasional rest, which will help him/her make it through the tournament intact, and you keep the offense on their toes since no two people defend exactly the same way. In order to help the learning curve when putting in a new defender, the primary defender should also take a few seconds to brief the backups on what s/he has already figured out so that it hopefully takes less time to fill the role than it would have otherwise.\n3. If it\u0026rsquo;s broken, fix it promptly.\nA defense cannot afford to allow easy scores. Even if the defense gets scored on eventually in a given point, one of their jobs is to make the other team\u0026rsquo;s offense grind it out and get them tired. A tired offense gets sloppy and makes mistakes, which leads to that break opportunity. Also, in situations where your offense is working hard for their scores, it\u0026rsquo;s really important for the defense to stay on the field to give them the time to recover so they can be productive on the next offensive point.\nIf within 2 points, the opposition\u0026rsquo;s offense has scored without so much as a contested throw, something has to change. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be drastic since those kinds of changes might take longer than a point or two formulate and implement, but even something as slight as a few matchup switches or a force change or throwing a zone could shake things up a little bit and make your defense more effective.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget about the big picture.\nHow you decide to use your \u0026ldquo;best\u0026rdquo; defender(s) from game to game requires taking a big picture look at overall strategy for the tournament. What are your goals for the tournament? Which are the games you have to win? Which games (if any) can you afford to lose? Which are the games you would like to win but don\u0026rsquo;t have to win? At what point do you consider a game to be a lost cause (and is this even an acceptable thing to consider)? Answers to these kinds of questions can help lead you in the right direction when thinking about when and how much to use your defensive studs.\n"

A defensive unit should utilize their strengths to maximize their impact on the opposing teams offense.\nSo, the next question is, how does one do that?\nWell, assuming you have an understanding of their offense (vert, horo, etc.), how they run it (in vert, are they breaking the mark to create flow or jamming it open side; in horo, do they look to the middle pair or try and hit the wings), and who is having the biggest impact in keeping it going (is the main handler anchoring the offense or do they rely on a stud cutter to open up the downfield), it is a matter of matching up your players to win more of the matchups.\nFor example, if they have a standout handler that is the anchor to their offense, trying to shut them down with your best defender is probably not the best allocation. A dump is probably still a 90% completion rate with your best defender on them and if the handler is doing his job, the disc will spend more time downfield in the flow of the offense, leaving your best defender out of the play more often than not, minimizing his chances of getting a block.\nA better allocation might be a tall defender who\u0026rsquo;s reach can interupt the handlers first and second options, slowing the offense down. Also, putting your best defender on a cutter who seems to get a lot of touches would also be a good option as your best defender will be more involved in the play (can poach, help easily on deep looks, etc), increasing his chances of getting a block (downfield cutter getting 3 touches a point with your best defender who might get a block 10% of the plays he is involved in, means he should get a block once every 4 points).\nThis also has a residual effect that the handlers might second guess using this cutter causing them to use second and third options downfield which will get higher stall counts, more pressure on guys who may not get the disc as much to play a more active role, and elongates play, giving your top defender more chances at a big play downfield.\nJust like the card game, you are very rarely going to be able to win every matchup, and in the cases that you can, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to worry about defensive matchups. Putting your worst defender on their best player, while having better matchups on 5 or 6 of the other players may seem counterintuitive, but can play into your team\u0026rsquo;s hands. You know your team, its how you use your team\u0026rsquo;s resources that will decide the outcome of the game.\n"

  "content": "In a person defense, getting the right matchups can be critically important. It can also require some trial and error. Teams which face each other all the time get to try out a number of different approaches until they get most comfortable. Teams that don\u0026rsquo;t see each other often have a challenge at the start—but fortunately both teams have that challenge. The team that figures out how to neutralize (or at least slow down) the key threat from the other team the fastest can get an advantage early in the game.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t believe that there is any \u0026lsquo;best\u0026rsquo; defender on a team. I think that this is situational. For example, if the other team has a handler driven offense—especially if it focuses on 1-2 key handlers—then you will likely need a different defender than if the team plays a wide open offense that relies on 1-2 key upfield cutters to make the action happen.\nTherefore, I believe, early in the game, it\u0026rsquo;s important to see if you are simply \u0026ldquo;better\u0026rdquo; than the other team. Try to match up your strength against their strength down the line. Best upfield defender on the best upfield cutter for the other team. Best handler defender on the best handler defender of the other team. If it is working, don\u0026rsquo;t change it. Win the game and get a beer. What if it isn\u0026rsquo;t working? What levers do I pull now?\nA. Defensive Call. Even in a person-defense, there are choices which I try usually before swapping matchups. The team is killing our forehand force with breakmarks, go to backhand. You might just make your defenders a step better by changing the mark. Try a Zone. (\u0026ldquo;Never lose without trying a zone defense\u0026rdquo;—just ask Fury about that.) Try changing the distance on the mark.\nB. Get Fresh. Ultimate games are long. Did you ever watch Pete Sampras play tennis? He won his service games. That was practically a given. (And you need your offense to be similar if the game is close.) When he was receiving serve, he often looked horrible. He\u0026rsquo;d step into the court and try to crush a few returns. If he missed, he lost at love. If he got the first two, then he kept at it and won. Set over. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to get every defensive point. Rest your studs, or a few of them, on a few of the points. Get everyone as strong as possible and make a run at the next point.\nC. Switch Some Matchups. Sometimes your key defender is not at his/her best. Switch an on field matchup. But your best on their second option and your second on their best option. Maybe a help D shows up.\nD. Think About How You Are Getting Beat. Is the other team getting deep shots? Are they squirreling up field? Put your best defenders in a position to stop what\u0026rsquo;s working. If they are winning with deep shots, and you have a tall stud, use a defense that keeps him/her in center field. If your best defender has a shut down mark, get that mark on the disc so those deep shots aren\u0026rsquo;t quite as good or don\u0026rsquo;t get up at all.\nDefensive matchups aren\u0026rsquo;t prescriptive. Like so much else in Ultimate, it\u0026rsquo;s the team that makes the right adjustment the fastest that will win the close ones.\n"

If we are talking about semis at Nationals, and I have a great downfield defender and the other team has a great downfield offensive player, then my defender is going to be on that offensive player for as long as they are effective. If this is pool play at Nationals, than I feel like it is somewhat necessary to share the load for fear that you may wear out your best defensive player during Day One.\nIf a team scores twice pretty effortlessly, I am inclined to call a defensive strategy switch. There are times when I may let it go to the third point depending on circumstances.\nSuperstar matchups depend on a few things:\nDoes the superstar defender get lots of Ds on down-fielders who do not touch the disc as much as your token handler? Does the superstar defender get lots of Ds on dump throws/cuts? Does the superstar defender get hand blocks/have a great mark? Does the superstar defender simply cloak his/her offender and never gets any Ds but yet you wonder what happened to the other team\u0026rsquo;s best player? I have met players in my life who simply like to get Ds and are very, very good at it. Those types of players are effective at positioning their bodies on in-cuts to get that picturesque layout D. Therefore, I think it is wise to keep this superstar defender on a downfield offensive player who does not touch the disc as much but when they go to cut for the disc that defender is 100% ready to play their part.\nI have also met players who get few Ds but pressure the other teams\u0026rsquo; best handlers into making poor decisions or simply disappearing. They occasionally get the layout D on the handler dump, but in general their defensive blocks are not visible to common spectator\u0026rsquo;s eyes.\n"

  "author": "Adam Goff",
  "issue": "016",
  "content": "Offenses used to look to get the disc near the sideline and then attack from there. Teams didn\u0026rsquo;t want to be right on the sideline—with a foot on the edge hoping to attack from there, but a vertical stack offense looks to move the disc to ~5-10 yards from one sideline, take a good long look up field and then swing it around and try the other sideline. This offense can still be effective and all teams should have the ability to use this, even as simply a change of pace.\nFirst, let me eliminate an obvious situation, as there is always a reason not to do something. When the wind is strong and blowing cross field, you do have to stay away from the downwind sideline. The wind becomes an extra defender and it allows the defense to overplay.\nAll offenses have the same basic philosophy: you need to create space in a way that gives you the advantage over the defense. This is difficult to do, because there are 12 people upfield and it can get very crowded. On defense, it\u0026rsquo;d be great to have 8 or 9 people on your side. On offense, often you want to have about 4—big open spaces to throw into. Therefore, you have to make more of the field available.\nWhen using the sideline, you can afford at most 2 people in the area directly upfield of the disc. The others must keep the attention of their defenders, and keep them from poaching. This poaching is, of course, a big risk, because the players not upfield are usually a bit less of a threat, so their defenders can range off of them farther than usual. However, note two things about this: First- poachers only come from one side of the field. This is different than an attack that uses the middle of the field. Defensive help can come from both sides of the attack. Second- if they leave the players on the far side, those players do become threats. Immediately, the open offensive player is a threat to take off deep (if the poacher went in) or to come in (if the poacher went deep). So, movement and preparedness is important there.\nMore importantly, an attack on the sidelines dares the defense to overplay it. The offense is all but begging the defense to come and take the sideline away. As an offense, send the disc around and take a ton of free yards. A sideline attack must plan to attack both sidelines.\nSo, a few keys to remember:\nHaving an offense that attacks the sidelines is necessary—if for no other reason than to change the look\nAttacking a sideline requires that the offense creates space—in, out, throw towards the middle or straight up field\nThe other sideline is the key to success—all players must be ready to swing, clear space, and use it\n"

  "content": "The value of the sideline space depends on the offense. In a horizontal offense, the sideline limits your options. In a vertical offense, it\u0026rsquo;s a great place to be—until it isn\u0026rsquo;t.\nHorizontal\nFrom a downfield cutter\u0026rsquo;s perspective, one unique benefit of the horizontal offense is that it lets you make cuts across the mark. With so much uncrowded horizontal space between the cutters and the thrower, you can threaten an open-side cut, then change direction to receive a breakmark pass. (Even a great defender cannot take away the open side and the break side, and a good thrower will be able to open up either the i/o or around break.) Some teams call this a \u0026ldquo;stop cut\u0026rdquo;—a short-yardage cut across the field and back, where the cutter often gains the disc with a 1-2 second unmarked throwing window. It\u0026rsquo;s a great way to get a horizontal offense flowing.\nWith the disc on the sideline in a horizontal offense, however, you lose the option of cutting across the mark. From a cutter\u0026rsquo;s perspective, there are fewer \u0026ldquo;sweet spots\u0026rdquo; on the field where a thrower can likely deliver an accurate pass. From a defender\u0026rsquo;s perspective, you have a much better idea of where your man wants to cut. Advantage defense. This isn\u0026rsquo;t to say that your horizontal offense can\u0026rsquo;t make lemonade from sideline lemons. (Indeed, any offense will end up on the sideline, so you should learn how to make the best of it—and I\u0026rsquo;m sure some other Huddle contributors have given good ideas to this effect.) But, in my experience, it\u0026rsquo;s easiest to deal with problems, whenever possible, by avoiding them.\nI place the responsibility largely on the handlers. Good defenses will recognize that the middle of the field is more dangerous to them, so they\u0026rsquo;ll often use a dump defender to poach the passing lane. One possible response is for the offense to swing the disc to the poached sideline handler. A better response, though, is to have your handlers cut towards the middle of the field. For example, if you\u0026rsquo;re being forced forehand, and your forehand-side handler is being poached, send him on a 20-yard sprint from the sideline, behind the thrower, to the break side: the thrower pivots to the backfield, keeps his hips between the marker and the break side, and delivers a little flip pass to the streaking handler, who receives the disc ahead of his defender, open for a 1-2 second unmarked breakside throwing window. Even if the defense recovers, you\u0026rsquo;ve reset the stall and maintained possession at midfield. As a downfield cutter, I like the look of this setup much better than a narrower sideline cutting lane.\nAnother easy adjustment is to create terminology that emphasizes how much you like the middle of the field. When we\u0026rsquo;re running horizontal, my team calls the middle 20 yards of the field \u0026ldquo;on stage,\u0026rdquo; and the 10 yards closest to each sideline \u0026ldquo;off stage.\u0026rdquo; We want the disc on the stage. (As an aside: we also want no more than two cutters on the stage at a time.) If the disc is off stage, we want to get it back on stage. If you have the disc on stage, then you can look downfield an extra second or two before you look to reset. If you receive the disc off stage, you look flow for a second or so, then get the disc back to the stage right away.\nVertical\nIn a vertical offense, the sideline is like a good party—you can have a great time, but if you stay too long, you\u0026rsquo;ll wear out your welcome.\nAgain, I look at this from a downfield cutter\u0026rsquo;s perspective. If my teammates and I are clearing space effectively (a big \u0026ldquo;if,\u0026rdquo; which even many elite teams fail to achieve), then every downfield throw goes to a cut that originates in the vertical center of the field. This means that the cutter can choose the angle that will seal his defender from a play on the disc, and it means the thrower has a high margin for error, since a cutter can change his angle to account for an overthrow or underthrow. (If a cutter is entirely vertical to the thrower, on the other hand, he can only account for a throwing error by running faster or jumping higher.) As long as our cuts are originating from the middle of the field, we\u0026rsquo;re going to have good angles and high completion percentages. If we work it up a single sideline, and every cut comes from the vertical center of the field, then I\u0026rsquo;m happy with our offense—even if every single pass is received within 5 yards of the same sideline. It\u0026rsquo;s all about the percentages.\nVertical offenses break down when cutters don\u0026rsquo;t recycle fast enough. If the disc advances and cutters fail to push far enough downfield ahead of the disc, then defenders can back their man, knowing that the offense won\u0026rsquo;t benefit much from a 5-yard in-cut jammed to the sideline. Similarly, if cutters fail to recycle to the vertical midfield (i.e., if they crowd the flow-side sideline), then their cuts (deep or underneath) will have no horizontal angle to the thrower, and the completion percentages will fall. At this point, it\u0026rsquo;s the handlers\u0026rsquo; job to reset the offense. If you have a smart and hardworking corps of cutters, then all the handlers need is to throw a pass or two. (Swinging the disc to the opposite side of the field is always a good thing, but not essential.) Mainly, the handlers are buying time, keeping the stall count fresh, while the cutters recycle, create passing lanes, and put themselves in position to enter the lanes on good angles. Then, whether we\u0026rsquo;re attacking a new side of the field or not, we are cutting on angles that give us high downfield completion percentages.\n"

  "content": "An organized approach to sideline situations gives the offense a great advantage. For example: a well-isolated huck down the line or a series of swings to the breakside. Unprepared and against a good defense, a team facing a sideline trap will likely turn the disc over. I would challenge any team to spend more time practicing from the sideline. Most teams have only one play for the sideline, and many for a centered disc. Most teams design their plays to start from a stopped disc. Most teams draw up their endzone offense assuming the disc centered, ten yards out. Most teams do not train for when things break down. Like most teams, Sub Zero spends the majority of its energy developing strategy for the middle of the field, for the best case scenario, and for the O-line catching the pull, though this represents the minority of our actual offense. Teams that use wishful thinking when designing strategy and drilling will get forced into unplanned situations by a good defense. No situation more exemplifies this than the sideline trap.\nSub Zero ends practice with a scrimmage, O-line versus D-line. If the O-line scores, they pull to the D-line. The D-line calls a play, receives the pull, and centers the disc. Yet this never happens in a game. Why not instead have the D-line set up on the sideline with the disc? Why not spend entire practices with possessions starting randomly around the field, giving the team only 20 seconds to set up? Or, do the same but ask your players to set up out of position with no play call. You could practice offensive possessions with your team setting up a play, but start with a swing to the trap and flow from there. Your frustration in that practice will lead you to develop strategy for those situations. I suggest that every team dedicates fifty percent of its practice\n"

  "issue": "016",
  "content": "Field spacing depends on the offense your team is running. This is dictated in part by the defensive strengths of the team you are playing and in part by your own team\u0026rsquo;s strengths.\nIn the mid-to-late 1990\u0026rsquo;s, the offense of choice for us (Furious) was the vertical stack. In the vertical O, the idea is to move the disc to one sideline or the other and flood the stack to the other side of the field, thus isolating a cutter. The shorter the stack the better—thus allowing for more effective deep cuts. We used this offense very successfully as we had tall and fast receivers. Defenses at the time where not very sophisticated—except for DoG who was able to use the \u0026ldquo;clam\u0026rdquo; to slow things down. However, around 2000 teams started to get wise to the fact that it is pretty easy to poach on in or out cuts in the vertical setup. When the players in the stack flood—defenders just sit in the lane—and there is nowhere to go. Suddenly, the sideline is a war zone where cutters have to battle for every 5 yard gain.\nThen we adapted and started the \u0026ldquo;West Coast\u0026rdquo; Horizontal Offense. At first it did not really matter where the disc was on the field. Teams were slow to adjust and we had our way for a number of years. We were able to cut out or come under for big yards, as defenders did not know how to match up against us.\nIt was not until Sockeye started to figure out that if the disc is on the sideline in Horizontal O, that a deep poach on the far side of the field is possible. It took them a couple of years to perfect it, but eventually they did and this created all kinds of problems for our team. Having the disc on the sideline was a terrible place to be once again—and we had to work hard to break our old habits and move the disc to the middle of the field. In Horizontal O, if the disc is in the middle of the field—it is really hard to poach, as defenders have to play more honest on their checks—and the thrower has access to the entire field.\nThe game has now evolved to the place where handlers are even more important than ever to moving the disc. In years past, the handler could just be a reset/babysitter of the disc. However, with the latest improvements in defense, handlers are required to constantly attack and look for the disc. The \u0026ldquo;flip\u0026rdquo; to the handler (a play that 4 years ago was very rare) is now commonplace and a necessity for a team to have offensive success.\nThe best philosophy in today\u0026rsquo;s game is to:\nKeep the disc in the middle of the field Activate handlers to move the disc and to keep the angles changing downfield for the defenders. † Our team has the advantage of having played together for many years. We will change our offensive sets from vertical to horizontal to split to stretch to keep the other team on their toes. This constant changing of styles allows for a team be most effective. My advice is to work on a variety of offensive sets. This variety will also pay off for your defensive line, as you cannot always be sure of the style that a team will play against you.\n† This is much like a power play in hockey where the offensive players move the puck around the perimeter of the defenders looking to change angles, which creates a breakdown in positioning and an opportunity to strike.\n"

  "content": "Typically, our offense thinks of the sideline as a trap if we are being forced to that sideline. Given the right thrower, it could be a land of opportunity as it is much easier to destroy a defense with one break throw from the trap sideline. But, given that there are few throwers that skilled on a team, as a whole, the sideline is viewed as a trap.\nThe sideline is a trap because it gives throwers who do not consistently break the mark a very small window to work with when throwing to an in-cutter. The target is probably about two feet by two feet and there is no space (unless you can throw break) for the thrower to throw to. Therefore, there is no room for error. If you are a smart defense, and there is a significant amount of wind, you will force to the downwind sideline. Now, not only are half of the hucks down the sideline going to be out of bounds, but you will have a much more difficult time breaking the mark because it will be into the wind. Typically, our offensive motto has always been, \u0026ldquo;find the upwind sideline and stay on it.\u0026rdquo;\nHow can teams train to use sideline space most effectively? Spend as little time there as possible, but make large gains with your time there. For instance, if you have a really good thrower with the disc on the sideline it may be best to set up an away cut from the opposite sideline or a break cut. Also, nothing destroys a defense more than getting the disc trapped on the sideline and then letting the team work it effortlessly off the sideline. Therefore, visiting the sideline is not the worst thing in the world; just don\u0026rsquo;t plan on staying for too long.\n"

After a turn in a scrimmage just stop for a second, throw the disc to the side and start again. If you are comfortable on the sideline—attacking or moving off it—your team will excel.\n"

  "title": "The Extra Defender",
  "author": "Jeff Eastham-Anderson",
  "issue": "016",
  "content": "I\u0026rsquo;ve always viewed the sideline as an extra defender that can be utilized by the defense to gain an advantage, especially in a vertical stack offense. As the disc moves to the sideline, the thrower and cutters have less viable space to work with, which restricts them to two kinds of viable cuts; a deep cut and an under cut. For a defender, shutting down these two sideline options simplifies the task that is presented when the disc is in the middle; a deep cut, an under cut, and a break mark.\nAs soon as the defense adjusts their positioning to the two remaining options, the offense loses whatever advantage it gained in moving the disc to the sideline. As such, it is my belief that the sideline is a land of limited opportunity that quickly turns into a trap. Offenses would be best served by capitalizing quickly on any advantage presented by a sideline situation, but then turn immediately to the task of getting the disc off the sideline, and present the defense with a different set of cuts to defend.\nThe defensive advantage on the sideline is magnified when considering dump throws to simply reset the disc. In the middle of the field, the dump has the option of working entirely on the open side, greatly reducing the influence of the mark on completing a throw. A sideline position, on the other hand, requires the dump to work around the influence of the marker, and again reduces them to two options if they want to make a cut; up the line, or behind the disc.\nFurthermore, I would argue that isolating one or two downfield cutters is not a pure advantage to the offense (regardless of sideline or midfield positioning), as the defense is usually also aware of this isolation, and can adjust accordingly. Even if it is as simple as the defender on the isolated cutter being prepared to react to the cutter, or as complex as shifting defenders to crowd the open side, the defense can reduce the advantage of isolating a cutter.\nAs for training to use the sideline effectively, two things need to happen. First, the players on your team need to buy into the same philosophy. As somebody who espouses the \u0026ldquo;move off the sideline quickly\u0026rdquo; point of view, nothing is more infuriating than seeing a thrower stare down a receiver in the lane for eight seconds before turning to the dump. Likewise, I\u0026rsquo;m sure that a cutter in the lane who thinks \u0026ldquo;the sideline is a land of opportunity,\u0026rdquo; and got open at stall nine would also be upset at seeing the thrower looking at the dump. Second, everybody needs to get on the same page in terms of the types of throws and movements that are in line with the philosophy you choose. I\u0026rsquo;ve always been a big fan of playing full games that have one tweak to emphasize a certain idea. For example, if you want to work on moving the disc off the sideline quickly, make a count of six be a turnover. Alternatively, if you want to work the sideline, make any dump throw before stall seven a turnover. Small changes like these seem silly and contrived when you first try them, but work very well if they are implemented correctly and limited to a specific goal.\n"

  "title": "Three Lane Theory",
  "author": "Greg Husak",
  "issue": "016",
  "content": "I tend to think of the Ultimate field in three lanes running down the field. When the disc is in one of the side lanes, you really only have that lane and the middle lane available, as throws to the far lane are quite risky. Sometimes focusing on just two lanes can mean that you reduce the complexity for the thrower and the offense, and it limits the angles that poachers can come from. However, as a defender, I have always felt much more comfortable when the other team has the disc on the sideline (with certain exceptions) rather than in that middle lane. As a thrower I like the freedom of using all three lanes to throw to, and also having a lot more variety of options with a dump for a reset. For all these reasons I prefer using the middle third of the field as an offensive player.\nThe biggest thing to focus on in attacking the sideline is keeping good space between players upfield. Whether utilizing a vertical or horizontal stack, the players must be spaced such that they have multiple cutting options, and their movements must be coordinated enough to create space for one another to avoid poaches and picks.\nHaving an offensive philosophy stressing certain movement principles (for example: cut deep from the middle lane and in up the side lane; or clear that side lane for more horizontal cuts from the middle-lane while deep players come back toward the thrower up the middle) will provide guidance to the cutters in flow and give them an idea about the general circulation of the offense. Within that structure players can take advantage of what the defense is giving them to move the disc up the field.\n"

  "title": "Yardage Opportunities",
  "author": "Chris Talarico",
  "issue": "016",
  "content": "The sideline is a great space to look to gain yardage. If your dump can beat his defender up the line, it should be a relatively easy pass to space in front of him, and he can then potentially hit a deep throw. This is probably the best way to get off a high percentage huck (and doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily need to happen on the sideline). It\u0026rsquo;s easy for the downfield cutters to time a deep cut when they see this up-line cut developing, and the thrower can use his momentum to get off a big throw.\nOf course, this is just one option. Like every other play ever drawn up, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work every time. No matter what part of the field you want to attack, you need to be able to move the disc off the sideline. Generally, an offense is most effective when it changes the point of attack - that is, downfield throws can (and do) come from the middle of the field and both sidelines. This means using swing passes to move the disc laterally. Using the whole width of the field puts far more stress on a defense than working down just one sideline. If the disc stays on one sideline, the defenders can limit their focus to cuts toward that sideline, so they only have to worry about guarding in-cuts vs. out-cuts. On the other hand, when the defenders aren\u0026rsquo;t sure where the disc is being thrown from, it forces them to respect a cut to almost any part of the field, making their job that much more difficult.\n"

  "issue": "015",
  "content": "Not everyone can be great at everything and some become very good at a few things. There are times where we have a few players who are very, very good at a particular position - whether defensive or offensive. For example, I have been on teams where we have a few players who sole purpose in life is to give the handlers on the other team h***. That is their job, and is why they are on the team. Now, I do not think these players should not be allowed to work on their offensive game or guarding downfield players. But, when it is go time, those players should be excited that they have a special gift to give to their team. The role player is important because it allows players to focus, when it matters, on individual tasks.\nShould teams look for new players that fit certain roles? Personally, I think it depends on the player. I have met and/or played with a few special players who can be more versatile and should never be limited to a constrained role. Usually those players are the \u0026ldquo;no-brainers\u0026rdquo; to make the team. After a team has solidified those recruits, then I think it is necessary to find players that can fill certain roles well that currently are unfullfilled on the team.\nThe physical defensive player and the athletic receiver are roles that I see becoming more important in the next 5 years at the top levels of the game.\nIn a way, I see very skilled throwers becoming less of an emphasis as the game grows. The crowd appears to be more enthralled by fantastic layout grabs and skies rather than pretty, perfect, no drama throws. That does not mean I necessarily agree with it, but I think we are in for more turnover ultimate than ever before in the next four years.\nI absolutely think there is hope for the all-around player. But, instead of being 1 in 10 like the last twenty years, it may be more like 1 in 50 or 1 in 100 in the next five to twenty years.\n"

  "issue": "015",
  "content": "I started playing for Seattle\u0026rsquo;s Sockeye in the Spring of 2007. Among the great athletes and throwers and minds one thing stood out the most—an almost singular obsession on beating their main rival, Vancouver\u0026rsquo;s Furious George. Throwers needed to have five options because at nationals, against Furious, you could be sure four would not be open. Three-step separations were not enough, because Oscar and Alex could make it one. Running trap zone? With Savage and Cruickshank with the disc? Not likely. Any man-to-man against a cutter like MG would need a lot of help on the mark.\nCool story Hansel, but what\u0026rsquo;s the point? That Seattle team had players who using solely what they do best could walk to semis at nationals. Disc to Ben to CK x 15 x 5. But what would happen when they got there? What happens when that team comes up against another that can stop their best option?\nIf you can beat a team going to your number one option over and over again then that team, relative to yours, is bad. Either they don\u0026rsquo;t have the personnel to match your athleticism, experience, or whatever it is you are beating them with, or they are not smart enough to make that necessary adjustment to stop getting beat. Either way; they\u0026rsquo;re bad. So bad, in fact, that you probably would be able to beat that team using any strategy you choose—what\u0026rsquo;s winning the game isn\u0026rsquo;t just your one play or move, rather it\u0026rsquo;s your \u0026lsquo;specialty\u0026rsquo; combined with the threat of everything else you could do.\nThink about elimination games between two close teams—how many times does one team actually use their \u0026lsquo;specialty\u0026rsquo;? The top handler throwing long to the best receiver works, if they are both playing great, maybe three times. Significant, yes, but they still need 12 other ways to score. Deeps will be backed (defender positioned between the player and the endzone), and throwers will be faced straight-up. The best one-on-one defenders, who already get beat plenty, can stop only their assignment; there are six others. This applies just as well to team\u0026rsquo;s specializing in using players solely to their strengths: Teams that live on breaking the mark find non-mark defenders adjusting to the dead side. A team\u0026rsquo;s best defensive line playing their best defense will generate maybe two or three additional blocks a game - which probably isn\u0026rsquo;t enough as it is, and they only have those seven players to score.\nDuring those games, being a \u0026lsquo;specialist\u0026rsquo; in this sport really means that other parts of you game will be proportionally easier. The better your specialty, the more your opponent will give up to stop it, but remember—good teams always will be able to. Then what? The backed deep threat will be given cuts back to the disc. But to be effective, first their cut has to be well-timed, and then they have to be able to throw the disc somewhere. Being able to make well- timed cuts either away or back to the disc, and being able to throw afterwards? Sounds fairly all-around to me. A great zone defensive team will soon find the opposing team\u0026rsquo;s best throwers making the majority of the throws, and be forced to defend person-to-person, necessitating the ability to do both. The best mark-breaker will be countered not only with better marks, but also more effort preventing them from catching the disc, either by greater athleticism in their defender, poaching, or both. Again, both the players and teams involved are all dependent on both their relative strengths and weaknesses. Against a good team, neither the team nor individual is good enough to rely on their specialty alone.\nOf course conversely, the better your opponent, the less they will need to sacrifice in order to take away your strength. Further, its easier for your opponent to focus on stopping your strength than your next options. Seattle knew that while relying on their best option would work early in tournaments, in those last two games, there would be teams with players that could stop it. What led to their successes was their singular focus on beating teams with players able to stop what they otherwise would do. Or, in other words, becoming an all-around team, filled with all-around players.\n"

  "title": "Needs Of The Team And The Individual",
  "author": "Greg Husak",
  "issue": "015",
  "content": "Role players are valuable to any successful team. More than valuable, they may be essential. This is typically because they have the ability to throw their whole effort into a part of the game that the stars don\u0026rsquo;t have the effort for. An obvious example of this is a marker in the zone. Marking takes a lot of effort, and is very tiring both because of chasing the disc around, but also because working hard on the mark takes a lot of energy. However, a zone can fall apart if the marks are not sprinting to the disc or being aggressive on the mark. Marking in zone is one of the more obvious examples of a specific role player, but almost any zone position can have a specialist, and even some offensive positions can be limited to the point of being a specific role.\nI think it is a great benefit for someone to fill specific roles, but this is also very dependent on the needs of the team and the expectations of an individual. I think it is wise for players to continuously expand their toolbox of tricks to make themselves more diverse. However, as a full season progresses, it benefits the team (and the individual) to start to focus on what has become their niche on the team. In other words, it would make no sense for a college player in January to decide that he is going to be the marker in the zone when he should be improving all aspects of his game (throwing, man defense, etc). But maybe by the time Sectionals comes around he should realize where his strengths lie and how he can best help the team succeed. By keeping up all his skills early in the season he might realize that there are others that are better suited to marking, or the captains can give more direction about what each individual should rely on. When picking a team, I think most teams would prefer the all-around player who can then fit into the teams needs as the season progresses. Certainly if someone is absolutely exceptional at a particular thing, they should play towards that strength, but I think that teams would generally prefer well-rounded players over specialists.\nIn the next five years I see the role of someone who can shut down the other team\u0026rsquo;s handler being very important. Good handlers know how to juke, get you off-footed, use space and keep you on your heels well enough to make guarding them tough. Also, teams rely on their handlers to be available for easy resets and to push the disc up the field. A person who can limit the effectiveness of the other team\u0026rsquo;s top handler can create a few breaks for their defense. This may mean that each team has a stable of two or three of these guys who, depending on the opponent, fill that role of primary defender.\nIn terms of less important roles, I think the deep receiver is going to become a thing of the past. Now so many strong athletes are playing defense that having the one guy who is tall, fast and jumps really well isn\u0026rsquo;t enough for you to just jack it to him without pause. More and more that guy is being guarded by an equally tall, fast and great jumper. Knowing how to set up cuts in flow, exploit a poach, or create space for teammates are going to be more valued skills than raw athleticism.\n"

  "author": "Jeff Eastham-Anderson",
  "issue": "015",
  "content": "Apart from specific match-ups on defense that require certain roles (being tall and fast, or short and quick), there are lots of roles in zone defenses and in some offensive sets. The best example I can think of is the marker on a trap-side zone defense. This is the position that anchors the zone when it is within 5 yards of the sideline, and can make or break the scheme. This person has the opportunity to take away more options that any other defensive player on the field. As the mark applies more pressure, there is a cascade behind them that allows the defense to take away other opportunities. For example, if the mark is able to remove cross-field hammers, the far-side defender(s) can play more to the middle of the field, allowing the players in the middle of the field to push closer to the open side threats.\nShould players train to be more versatile? I don\u0026rsquo;t think there is an absolute answer here. In a vacuum of information I would argue that as a player looking to make a team, you should invest in improving at all aspects of the game. Simply put; offensive lines still need to play defense, and defensive lines need to score after they get a turn in order to be successful. The world\u0026rsquo;s best thrower would be hard pressed to make the roster of an elite team if they couldn\u0026rsquo;t play decent match-up defense. You can argue that offensive lines don\u0026rsquo;t need to be great at defense, especially if they don\u0026rsquo;t turn the disc over, but you\u0026rsquo;d have to seriously question the wisdom of a defensive line with seven people unable to throw the disc.\nIf you are a player trying to make it onto a team that generally lacks a skill, or you are in charge of recruiting for a team that lacks a certain skill, by all means, train or recruit to address that weakness. As a team this means figuring out, before you pick your team, how you want to play the game. As a player this means trying to figure out, or asking the team leaders, what the team needs in a player.\nRegarding important roles, I don\u0026rsquo;t really know if any trends will emerge. However, I think there is a real opportunity for teams to improve by recruiting or training players to be smarter about their decisions, and to recognize opportunities earlier. There are some pretty significant hurdles to training athletes to make better decisions, but it is even harder to recruit smart players. For example, teaching the concept of creating space for a teammate to take advantage of is a fundamentally good thing. However, it is very hard to teach, is rarely recognized on a team as being important, and even more rarely rewarded when a teams is picking their roster.\nI think the newly instituted roster limits gives increased hope for all-around players, especially if the limit drops much further. With fewer spots on the roster, the argument for filling those spots with players that are proficient at both offense and defense becomes stronger. In an extreme example, if the roster limit was 14 and your roster was evenly split between defensive and offensive specialists, you\u0026rsquo;d be pretty hosed if somebody got hurt, or was off their game that day. A roster with a couple people that could fit into any hole would be more desirable.\n"

  "issue": "015",
  "content": "This is an interesting topic as the need for specialized roles has been born more out of necessity than out of desire in Vancouver.\nHistorically, the top players on Furious have been the players who excel at multiple aspects of the game. These players have been able to fulfill multiple roles, and truly have a very strong all-around game. Ultimate\u0026rsquo;s fast pace of play combined with multiple turnovers and unforeseen situations, calls for players on the field to be able to adapt and excel regardless of the circumstances.\nHowever, it is impossible to field a team of 7 \u0026ldquo;Al-Bobs\u0026rdquo;* every O or D line. Over the years, as the top players on Furious have retired, our team has been forced to move to specialized positions in order to continue to compete with the other top teams. This is a short term and problematic fix. I am sure that other teams have faced a situation where a player who is tall and who plays good defense is inserted into the lineup as a starting line defensive lane cutter—even if they are a poor thrower. We try to hide their weaknesses by surrounding them with more all-around players who can shoulder the offensive load on a turnover.\nThe same holds true on the other side of the disc. Teams are forced to play offensive players who are talented throwers—at the expense of athleticism and defensive ability. However, unless more high-level games go the route of the 2002 Semis with DoG and Furious (5 turnovers combined)—teams that rely on highly specialized personnel will eventually be exposed and struggle to compete for the UPA Championship.\nIn short, it is very important to work to become an all-around player. If you are relying on one part of your game to make a team, or to be on a starting lineup, or to win championships then you are not giving yourself the best chance for success. It is too easy for one part of your game to escape you on the big day, and you may need to rely on some of your other skills to get the job done.\n"

  "content": "I believe that what makes a team successful is its ability to use all of its players. Most good teams have a few superstars- those players that are game- changers and whose absence can really hurt the team\u0026rsquo;s chances. However, the difference between good teams and great teams, I believe, lies in how the team utilizes its role players. Ultimate is truly a team sport, and if the top players on a team aren\u0026rsquo;t supported by a solid and confident group of role players, the team will have many exploitable weaknesses.\nFor clarity, I\u0026rsquo;m defining a role player as someone who doesn\u0026rsquo;t have top-notch skills in every facet of their game (although hopefully they have top-notch skills in at least one part of their game, or else they\u0026rsquo;re unlikely to get on the field much!).\nSo how do you use and build up your role players? First of all, everyone on the team must be given a role that plays to their strengths. Secondly, everyone must know exactly what their role is (and isn\u0026rsquo;t!). If everyone on the team is asked to do the same things, and expected to achieve to the same degree, then some people are being set up to fail- you\u0026rsquo;ll be asking them to do things that they\u0026rsquo;re not able to do. And with failure comes lack of confidence, which causes more failure, etc. Instead, the team strategy should be designed to maximize the number of times players are put in situations in which they are likely to succeed. This means the strategy should depend on which players are on the field, and conversely, which players are on the field should depend on your strategy for that point. If your strength is being a great receiver, you should be expected to cut deep a lot, but then the team should make sure you have a high-percentage option to throw to. If your strength is as a big thrower, you might be expected to take more risks with your throws than other team members. If everyone is clear as to what they are and aren\u0026rsquo;t expected to do, people will be able to set themselves up to succeed as much as possible.\nSo how do players ever improve, if they\u0026rsquo;re only asked to do the things they\u0026rsquo;re already good at? This is a very important question to address, since pigeon- holing players into very specific roles can lead to them getting frustrated and bored, or at the very least to slowing their improvement. On our team, we divide the season into two halves. In the first half of the season, everyone is encouraged to work on expanding their game. We focus a lot on fundamentals, and teach the same things to everyone. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that everyone has a green light to go crazy. Rather, people are encouraged to work on things that are just outside their comfort zones, so that they push the envelope and work on expanding their repertoire. In the second half of the season, we ask people to take stock of where they are. The team leadership works with individuals to clearly outline roles and expectations that will enable the team and the individuals to maximize their rate of success.\n"

She doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the best break-mark throws in the game and can\u0026rsquo;t guard every quick little handler. However, she is the scariest mark I\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen in a 1-3-3. Luckily, we play in bad weather conditions at Sectionals, Regionals and Nationals (usually) so we can run a lot of zone. We will often put Michelle in just to run the 1 in the 1-3-3 for one point and then do it again the next time we\u0026rsquo;re on defense.\nI believe that the best players all start with a superpower. Michelle\u0026rsquo;s is her zone mark. Surge is really fast. Vivian can throw anywhere on the field at anytime. This is a great starting point for each player, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t all also continue to work on reading the disc, downfield defense or dump cuts. In a game, we will always use a player\u0026rsquo;s specialty, but the more well-rounded they are around that, the better they will be able to perform in multiple situations.\nIn the next 5 years at the level of elite women\u0026rsquo;s ultimate, I see the most use for the combination of two roles within one player. For example, someone who can throw anywhere at will, but is also a very athletic defender. Right now there are lots of athletes and lots of throwers, but rarely are these combined (Deb Cussen is the prototype). I think that there will always be roles for all-around players. I would still suggest that all-around players work on something that they want to be their superpower—playing defense on the other teams tallest player, winning every disc in the air, or being able to make 10 cuts at top speed during one point—but then also developing other parts of their game to make themselves the best all-around defender as possible and to be as difficult to guard as possible.\n"

  "content": "We\u0026rsquo;ve all seen certain players take over games, throwing hucks, getting lay out Ds, or getting open against good defenders. These players are revered. What is a role player? Everyone else.\nI avoid using the term \u0026ldquo;role player\u0026rdquo; because it implies a value judgment on those players who don\u0026rsquo;t get the glory. The player who throws hucks isn\u0026rsquo;t a role player. The player who uses his mark to stop the hucks is a role player. You might not notice the second guy but he\u0026rsquo;s why his team wins games (instead you think the thrower \u0026ldquo;just had a bad game\u0026rdquo;).\nThe year Sub Zero went to semifinals their offense featured a slow player with bad throws whose job it was to set the stack and burn poaches. He played every O point and most points he didn\u0026rsquo;t touch the disc. Because of him the primary cutter had a cutting lane. Sub Zero acknowledged this guy\u0026rsquo;s contribution in the huddle, even though to other teams he was a joke. Had he not gotten credit for his role, he might have gotten greedy for the cutting lane. On every team, a few players will garner the attention and draw the cameras. The rest of us need to find ways to contribute quietly. How a team treats the players who don\u0026rsquo;t get the glory affects the team\u0026rsquo;s performance.\nPlayers should not be fitted to roles for strategic purposes. The role should be fitted to the player. Strategy in Ultimate and especially in college Ultimate is reactionary. In the 1990s almost all college teams played a vertical stack with two handlers. In the 2000s the Hodags brought the split- stack with three handlers and dominated. Today split-stack or some variant is widely used. People saw what worked and copied it. The thing is, split stack worked for the Hodags because it played to their strengths and because they understood it. As a strategy it is not in itself better than the vertical. As defenses adjust to the split and horizontal stacks, the vertical will come back. Every year 90% of college teams run approximately the same zone. A few teams did not get the memo, and they dream up their own zone. If these novel zones use the strengths of their players, they can surprise other teams. In Ultimate, roles are not platonic forms; they can be molded to the situation and to the player. A successful team uses whatever strategy best fits its players.\nOne of my first captains saw me working tirelessly to fix my weaknesses. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t do that,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;Spend 70% of your energy improving your strengths.\u0026rdquo; He was right. I\u0026rsquo;ll never win a game jumping. But I might win a game marking. Every player needs to excel in something, even if it\u0026rsquo;s something subtle. When the player deploys that skill, his confidence grows, he\u0026rsquo;ll relax, he\u0026rsquo;ll play within himself, and the team will benefit. What he does won\u0026rsquo;t get him on Clip of the Day. But he has developed a strength that he can count on in big moments. To develop a player, make him focus on his strengths. Then create a role for those strengths. As a team, celebrate his strengths. When he gets called a \u0026ldquo;role player,\u0026rdquo; he\u0026rsquo;ll just laugh. He knows what he\u0026rsquo;s contributing.\n"

  "issue": "014",
  "content": "When most players think about breaking the mark, they envision a thrower throwing around or over a stationary mark. However, I\u0026rsquo;d argue that the majority of break throws in high level ultimate don\u0026rsquo;t happen this way. Most breaks I see are simple forehands and backhands thrown in motion with the mark trailing behind the thrower.\nYou can be a great at switching fields with the Frisbee and have terrible \u0026ldquo;break throws\u0026rdquo;. Here are three keys. (Note that this scenario assumes the disc towards the force sideline and you set up slightly behind or parallel to the disc. However, these same principles can apply in other scenarios as well).\n1. Separation. Breaking the mark starts first with your legs. It makes your life much easier if you can get a good few yards of separation. The typical (but not only) move is to drive your defender a few yards up the line. Wait until she turns her hips, plant, and then go back towards the line of scrimmage. The defender has to respect the up-the-line cut, giving you a chance to create separation going back towards the Frisbee.\n2. Positioning. Once you have some separation, you need to make a key decision in a split second. It comes down to whether you want to secure the reset or go for a break strike. Lots of factors play into this decision; the competency of the thrower, the conditions, where the mark is standing, etc. If you decide to secure the reset, angle your cut to make the throw easy, regardless of how it sets up the break throw. If you like your chances on a slightly more difficult throw to space, you want to curl your cut towards the break side of the field. The thrower should lead you in this direction with a somewhat floaty throw. Make sure that you put your body between the disc and your defender. When you catch the disc, you are moving in the direction you want to throw with the defender behind you. Getting this angle right is an art not a science, and mastering it is key to getting this break off easily.\n3. The Release. Don\u0026rsquo;t stop. You have two and a half steps to throw the disc without committing a travel violation. Use these steps to maintain separation. Throw in stride. (You may need to set a very quick pivot foot to get off a forehand, but not necessarily with a little backhand flip.) It helps to practice catching and throwing the disc on the run, working on making your release as quick and accurate as possible.\n"

  "issue": "014",
  "content": "What is your favorite \u0026lsquo;move\u0026rsquo; for breaking the mark? How do you do it, and in what situations do you find it most useful?\nTo break the mark, I typically like to convince, or deceive, the mark that I am going to throw a different throw than what I want.\nFor example, if I am being forced flick and I want to throw the around backhand break, I will get into a very threatening inside out forehand flick position. Since my break flick gets released pretty close to my knees, or the ground, and is on the right side of my body, typically the mark will start to lean over towards that position. Once I have noticed that they have committed their center of gravity to defending the break flick, I will immediately pivot over to my backhand side and complete the throw.\nWhat is most important in teaching young players to break the mark?\nYounger players can afford to make more mistakes, and I truly believe you are not going to learn how to break the mark if you never attempt to in the first place. Therefore, I think it is most important to teach young players to just do it and do not fret too much if it is a turnover. Whether it is a turnover or not, I ask the younger player to reflect on their throw and recount what made it successful/unsuccessful.\nWhich do you feel is more important: Having a lot of players that can break the mark, or having some players on the field that can break the mark very well?\nTough question. I think it is important to have a lot of players that can break the mark. If everyone can break the mark somewhat, it means every cut is dangerous whether it is to the break side or not. If half your players can not break the mark that successfully, good defenders are going to catch on. If that smart defender is guarding a player who can not break the mark, they may let that player catch the disc in a tough position on the field (sideline, close to endzone, etc). Then, they will hope that their mark could force a turnover and that the other defenders downfield would recognize that the player with the disc can only throw to the open side. Therefore, those players would clamp down defensively and the offense as a whole would come to a complete halt. I would rather have no one that puts the team offensively in that position than have a few people who just dominate marks.\n"

  "content": "Sometimes the easiest way to break the mark is just to let someone else do it. I mean, break throws are hard. Do I really want to go to the trouble of pivoting all over the place, faking out the mark, getting off a potentially risky throw\u0026hellip; and then perhaps get hacked by the mark for my efforts? Forget it. I just don\u0026rsquo;t need that kind of hassle.\nNot everyone can break the mark at will, and even for those who have great break throws, it can still be a somewhat risky pass at times. Hopefully, some of the other authors have provided some good tips on actually getting off break throws\u0026hellip; here\u0026rsquo;s an easy way to get the disc to the break side that doesn\u0026rsquo;t require a skilled thrower:\nThis simple play can be applied anywhere on the field, but is particularly useful to punch it in when you\u0026rsquo;re near the goalline.\nSet a stack with 5 cutters, leaving just the person with the disc and one dump in the backfield.\nPosition the dump relatively close to the thrower on the open side (within 6-8 yards), and a couple yards behind.\nThe dump should start his cut going upfield. His defender needs to respect this upfield cut, and as soon as he commits to it (that is, when he turns his hips to run upfield), the dump needs to plant, and head back toward the thrower.\nThis cut should take him not directly at the thrower, but a just a couple yards behind him.\nNow all the thrower needs to do is put up a little dump pass, either straight back or slightly to the break side as the dump cuts across the field from the open side toward the break side.\nThe dump should receive the pass more or less directly behind the thrower, and allow his momentum to take him just past the thrower and his mark on the break side.\nAnd since the dump\u0026rsquo;s defender is trailing behind him, he should have an unmarked throw to space anywhere on the break side. He likely won\u0026rsquo;t have enough separation to stop, set himself and throw, but it should still be an easy backhand on the run because it just needs to go out to space to let a cutter run onto it.\n"

  "author": "Chelsea Putnam",
  "issue": "014",
  "content": "The best piece of advice I ever received about breaking the mark is that every fake must be a viable throw. You need to create space in order to break the mark; strong fakes are going to make that happen. Many defenders choose to watch only the disc when they are marking (don\u0026rsquo;t do that, defenders!) and therefore they are reacting to your fakes. By making realistic fakes, with the disc and your upper body movement, you will get your defender to shift their weight and be off-balance for a moment. That will create the space you need to break your mark.\nThis means not having two hands on the disc, which for newer players can be uncomfortable. You cannot throw the disc with two hands, so you should not be faking with two hands.\nIt also means faking at different levels. If you like to throw low, then you need to throw some high fakes to move the defenders hands up.\nIn addition, it means learning to throw multiple fakes on one side, either the forehand or backhand. It takes too much time when you simply pivot back and forth, and there is nothing wrong with throwing more than one fake on a side.\nThe bottom line is that your movements with the disc in your hand should have a purpose and be realistic. This will force your defender to be off-balance and will create the space you need to break the mark.\n"

Jeff Cruicshank with the disc. He seems to look break mark for a righty backhand, then he pivots big for his lefty inside out backhand, throws a quick, strong fake, and then he throws the inside out backhand to Grant. The throw is right in the sweet spot, safely away from Corey\u0026rsquo;s extended hand. The two pump fakes are a lesson in economy, followed by the big pivot.\nI pivot. That\u0026rsquo;s my favorite move. Pivot to the point where most players would pull a hamstring or fall over. In some of these clinics I\u0026rsquo;ve been running for area college teams, I\u0026rsquo;m puzzled by the lack of extended pivoting. How far can you step out there or how fast can you step through the mark? If I\u0026rsquo;m forced backhand (I\u0026rsquo;m a southpaw remember), I step as far as I can; rarely do I throw the step-back forehand. If the force is forehand, it\u0026rsquo;s very much the same. I pivot and deliver the inside-out usually at a 45 degree angle. If the throw is meant to be shorter, the effort is to step through the mark and deliver the backhand. This action leads to the second question here. The most important thing in teaching young players to break the mark is this: Your ambition to break the mark is what usually causes the foul.\nYou\u0026rsquo;re more than likely better off having two or three who are fundamentally sound, can hit a variety of throws, under different degrees of pressure, while the rest do what they\u0026rsquo;re supposed to do and play their role.\n"

My head and torso kind of lunge to one side, and I move the disc quite quickly in the same direction, but my lower body remains stationary. Essentially, I move just enough for the defender to commit to the big around, giving me a quick and easy inside break.\nWhat is most important in teaching young players to break the mark?\nPractice. Good mechanics and confidence should be the result of endless practice. Various studies and sources I\u0026rsquo;ve run across throw around some pretty large numbers when in comes to how many times you need to repeat a task before becoming truly proficient, and ten thousand is on the low side. If a young player thinks they\u0026rsquo;ve thrown enough, they haven\u0026rsquo;t.\nWhich do you feel is more important: Having a lot of players that can break the mark, or having some players on the field that can break the mark very well?\nBoth situations have their advantages, but if I had my choice I would prefer everybody on my team be able to break the mark, as opposed to have a couple people break the mark well. Apart from the complications the latter situation might produce in trying to create an offensive scheme, any time you have a predictable situation presented to the defense, if it can be stopped, it will eventually be stopped. If every time player X gets the disc they look to break the mark (because nobody else on the field can), the defense will eventually key in and plug that hole.\n"

  "issue": "014",
  "content": "By far the most effective \u0026ldquo;move\u0026rdquo; for breaking the mark that I\u0026rsquo;ve found is one that is rarely (but with increasing frequency) used in the women\u0026rsquo;s game. The general idea is that you throw a backhand over the mark\u0026rsquo;s shoulder (while being forced backhand) to the I/O lane, while using the step forward to throw as your first step running for the give-go.\nSpecifically, I try to throw in the space above the mark\u0026rsquo;s shoulder (not too near their face), and I throw down. This is important, as with most high- release throws, if you throw in the same manner as a normal or low-release throw, the disc will tend to sail over the receiver\u0026rsquo;s head. However, if you throw with some i/o on it, and in a downward direction, it will float enough to give the receiver enough time to run onto it. Additionally, if you transfer your weight from your pivot foot to your front foot (from left to right for rightys), then you\u0026rsquo;re already a step ahead of your defender, on the way to getting the disc back. I see this type of move far more frequently in the men\u0026rsquo;s game, where the quick give-go or dish to the handler seems more common (but it\u0026rsquo;s well on its way in the women\u0026rsquo;s side). One peril of this is that you get called for a lot of travels, mainly because when you transfer your weight to the front foot, even if your back foot is still down, it really appears that you\u0026rsquo;re running forward. The only solution I\u0026rsquo;ve come up with is to play with observers and request for them to make a call on travel/no travel.\nI think the most important thing in learning to break the mark is to think before you step up to the mark how you\u0026rsquo;re going to break it. That is, know what you want to throw, and figure out how you\u0026rsquo;re going to make them think you\u0026rsquo;re throwing something else. The other, really most important thing, is to be able to switch your grip from forehand to backhand with only one hand on the frisbee (don\u0026rsquo;t grab it with your off hand) extremely quickly and naturally. If you can\u0026rsquo;t move the disc to the right grip faster than your mark can move their feet, you\u0026rsquo;ll never get a throw off. (Also, markers often watch what grip you have and cheat to that side\u0026hellip; at least, I do.)\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s very important to have some players who can dish out the disc to anywhere on the field regardless of mark. But, that being said, it\u0026rsquo;s very very important for every player to be able to at least break a force for a dump throw. The throw I think is the most important here is if you\u0026rsquo;re trapped on the sideline and you need to throw a dump, it\u0026rsquo;s really key that everyone on the field is able to throw around the mark to the dump in the middle of the field. Bonus points if everyone can throw it to space, leading the dump out to an area where they have an easy continue throw to the break side before the mark can catch up.\n"

  "author": "Chris Ashbrook",
  "issue": "014",
  "content": "What I like to do is to not let the mark dictate the throw, but for the thrower to dictate the markers positioning and movements. In doing so, I find teaching young players to break the mark that you must first teach them to make themselves a threat while holding the disc. I consider the way I hold the disc similar to what is called a triple threat in basketball. To me, this means holding the disc in a throwing position. The throwing position that I teach young players is:\nFeet placement is shoulder length apart, maybe slightly wider. Knees are bent. Balance is centered. Hold the disc with a flick grip, ready to throw. Face the mark. Steps 1-3 allow the thrower to have a strong base position. This type of positioning allows the thrower to easily step out for the forehand and to pivot to the backhand. Many young throwers tend to be intimidated due to an aggressive marker straddling their pivot foot; this type of throwing position helps to reduce the amount of straddling\nHolding the disc in the flick grip, regardless of the force, provides the thrower with the greatest advantage for two reasons. First, holding in the flick position allows you to throw the flick, the hammer, scoober, and (if you are a good enough thrower to rotate the disc into a different grip) a thumber. Secondly, you are forcing the mark to respect the flick regardless of the mark\u0026rsquo;s force. Also, the rotation from flick to backhand is much smoother and easier than the rotation from a backhand to a flick.\nAs stated in step 5, I teach the thrower to face the mark. The benefits of facing the mark are that the mark is no longer able to position closely to your pivot foot, thereby allowing you to pivot more freely; and you force the mark to respect the flick regardless of the force. The flick is a very quick throw, so to break the mark you will only need to step out slightly and throw to space.\nWhat this positioning has done is you have forced the marker to make a decision. The marker can play you straight up, and you are able to get a quick and easy break mark throw off. Alternatively, they can overcompensate to the flick side which will then allow you pivot to break the mark with an easy backhand. Many times, with an aggressive mark, you will note that they overplay the flick position to start, and with a simple pivot they bust to stop the backhand (which they will do aggressively as well) opening up the easy flick break.\nAnother reason to face the mark, the closer you are to the sideline force, the more important it is to move the disc off the sideline, which will usually require some type of break throw.\nLastly, I try to teach throwers to recognize the angles and space to which they are throwing. I try to have them envision themselves in a triangle with the receiver. The third point being the space to which they are throwing. This works best with live people, as the throwers are able to see how the angle or place to where they are throwing the disc impacts the difficulty of the throw, and in turn the completion percentage.\nA 3 or 4 person drill used to help develop the easy break throws was to set up a 10 yds x 10 yds box. A thrower and maker would be at the bottom halfway between the bottom left and right corners, with the receiver and defender at the upper right corner. The marker would then mark at the appropriate 45 degree angle (flick) protecting the upper left corner. The thrower then initiates the throw to the upper left corner (either flick or around backhand) and the receiver trys to catch the disc within the box. Keep repeating. This helps the thrower learn how to move the mark and where the space is for break mark throws.\n"

  "content": "Every time a team moves the disc, this changes the defense. It puts the defensive players out of position, if even for a short period of time. The greater change is better for the offense, and this means putting the disc as far from where the defense wants it to be as possible. If a team is forcing you to throw forehand, and you get a chance to complete a pass straight up field, you just made a good move. If you get a chance to go a little more—30° say—then that\u0026rsquo;s a little better. But breaking the mark is just a successful throw that happened to go that way.\nI almost never think about breaking the mark. (I almost never think about the marker at all, really.) I know where I want the disc to be, and I know where the defense doesn\u0026rsquo;t want the disc to be. If I get a chance to put the disc there, then I need to be ready to take advantage of that chance. To me, this is no different than being able to take advantage of any open cut—open side, break side, anywhere. I want all of those throws to be as easy as possible, and to do that, I need the mark to move enough to make it easy.\nI think that every move that a thrower makes has to be a legitimate move to make a throw. Every move you make as a thrower, you are communicating to the mark, to your cutters, to the defenders upfield. Every move must communicate something. A \u0026ldquo;fake\u0026rdquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t do that. Idris Nolan wrote somewhere on the Internet that he never fakes. I believe that a fake is just a throw you didn\u0026rsquo;t let go of: it has to look the same. Now the marker doesn\u0026rsquo;t know what you\u0026rsquo;re doing, and moving your mark is simple. If I make a move to throw a backhand swing against a forehand mark (if everything I\u0026rsquo;ve done so far is something I could\u0026rsquo;ve thrown) then the marker moves just enough that I can throw little IO.\nWhen teaching newer players (or those up-fielders who just don\u0026rsquo;t get it) about throwing some of the more difficult throws, I almost never teach about \u0026ldquo;breaking the mark.\u0026rdquo; I talk about the importance of it, but I teach about moving the mark with controlled, committed motion. Every move could be a throw. Every move is done with balance.\nAnother thing that I work on with players which aids in breaking the mark is working on the shape of every throw. It\u0026rsquo;s important to put the disc in the right shape (flat to a straight cut, a little roll into the receiver, always leading the cut). Working on all of these shapes helps players break the mark, even if that\u0026rsquo;s not the topic at hand.\nOne more thought: remember that the goal is not to \u0026ldquo;break the mark.\u0026rdquo; The goal is to make it easy to score. It\u0026rsquo;s ok to take two throws to get it there. If there is a gimme throw up the gut to someone who can then easily push the disc over the break side. It\u0026rsquo;s just happened about as fast if you did it. It might be safer, and you\u0026rsquo;re still putting the defense out of position almost as quickly.\n"

  "author": "Miranda Roth",
  "issue": "014",
  "content": "My favorite move, that is very popular and can be used by any player, is the shimmy flick. This is a move that I was taught at Carleton but is based on principles that I learned in my first sport, basketball. In basketball as a defender, you are always taught to look at the offense\u0026rsquo;s belly-button because that is the hardest part of the body to fake with. You can get faked out if you look at the ball, the player\u0026rsquo;s head, feet or hands, but the belly button\u0026rsquo;s not going anywhere unless the whole player is too. In ultimate, as a thrower, to get the defense to move you have to move your belly button or, more realistically, your hips. To do the shimmy flick, you start squared up to the downfield and you want to move the mark to a right-handed player\u0026rsquo;s left side (to the backhand side) to open up the inside-out forehand lane. So you shimmy your hips to the left without changing your grip. As you shimmy, you\u0026rsquo;re actually winding up for a forehand so as the defender moves to the backhand side, you are preparing to throw a forehand. For more success step out to the forehand side and get low.\nAs a reference to my coaches, Michael [Baccarini of Paideia] and Tiina [Booth of Amherst], you can always break the mark by getting low. High releases may be fancy and fun, but in bad weather they will be bad throws. The most important thing to breaking the mark is getting low quickly and throwing with lots of zip.\nAs a team strategy, I think it is important to have some players on the field who can break the mark well and have all players on the field understand the limitations and preferences of every other player so they can cut to the proper place on the field.\n"

  "author": "Brett Matzuka",
  "issue": "014",
  "content": "Breaking the mark is key to scoring against solid defense and an important factor to any offense. Here are 5 ways to dictate play and gain an advantage over your mark:\n1. Expanding your options early (become more threatening)\nSince at the beginning of the game the defense is trying to figure out your strengths and weaknesses to properly apply pressure, this is your opportunity to take advantage and become more threatening. A good defender will start with a standard mark by trying to stop two primary breaks, the \u0026lsquo;inside-out\u0026rsquo; and the \u0026lsquo;around\u0026rsquo;. As play goes on, your mark learns from the options you take and changes their mark accordingly to make it harder on you. Having the disc, and knowing this, you have a chance to take advantage and become a bigger threat. If you use a throw, potentially less conventional (high release flick, scoober, push pass, etc.), you aren\u0026rsquo;t as confident in early when there isn\u0026rsquo;t much pressure being applied to that throw, you condition the defender to consider this a threat to their mark. With this, the defender will consider this option a potential break and adapt their mark to incorporate this. This will shift pressure off of your more confident throws, allowing you to use them effectively later in the game.\n2. Minimize Pivots\nEvery time you pivot, you are changing the downfield offense\u0026rsquo;s point of attack (break side or open side), reestablishing your balance, and wasting a stall count. An average pivot takes 1 stall count to perform, so if you pivot 3 times in one possession, you only have 1-2 stall counts to look up field before you will need to dump. This gives little time to set up and execute a break efficiently. By pivoting less, not just do you maintain better balance over the possession, but you make the pivot more valuable as the defender will not know when you\u0026rsquo;re going to pivot. This can catch the defender off balance, get them to over commit to an open side look or lure them into a false sense of security, increasing your chances of executing a successful break.\n3. Fake only what you can throw\nGood defenders are dynamic and are using every possession to get a better understanding of what you want to throw. Your mark is using every piece of information to hone in on what you prefer, and how to use this to generate turnovers. Faking a throw you don\u0026rsquo;t have not only wastes a stall count but also lets the defender know their pressure is working, gives the defender knowledge on what options you use and which you don\u0026rsquo;t, and encourages them to clamp down even more. Also, unnecessary fakes can become patterns to your throwing routine which good defenders can also catch onto. Maintaining composure and confidence during possession, instead of faking unnecessarily, will keep you focused on executing your throw and keep the defender from pinning down an optimal strategy for applying pressure to your throws.\n4. Don\u0026rsquo;t force it\nAll of us have done the 3-man mark drill. One person throws, one person receives and the last person puts on a hard straight up mark trying to prevent the pass (usually starting on some high stall count). In this drill, a defender will usually feel successful if they can manage a certain percentage of blocks/turnovers. In turn, the defender will clamp down on the strategy they have used that has been successful and apply more pressure and intensity, making it hard to dictate to the mark as you would want. In a game, this is much the same. By attempting to break unsuccessfully, your defender gains confidence in their marking strategy, and increases intensity and pressure. If you can manage to attempt less breaks but succeed a much higher percentage of the time (only take the option when you are 99% confident), it forces the mark to respect this option more by making them understand that any look to the break side, if thrown, is going to be a success. This will keep the defender reactive to you rather than vice versa.\n5. Make open side throws devastating\nThis one seems to be the most overlooked, and also most important. A good defensive unit is going to prevent offensive flow and make your offense score using their least favored options. For example, a good hucking offensive team will be forced to work the disc under against a good, smart defense. This idea is seen in tennis most often. A good tennis player will play to his opponent\u0026rsquo;s weakest shot the whole match. An opponent with an incredibly strong forehand but average backhand will be forced to hit 85% of this shots as backhands in order to win. Any big tennis fans will refer to Wimbledon \u0026lsquo;08 where Nadal defeated Federer. If you look back at this match, you will notice that Nadal played at least 80% of his shots to Federer\u0026rsquo;s backhand. This was not only because Nadal\u0026rsquo;s forehand is his weapon but because Federer\u0026rsquo;s least threatening shot is his backhand.\nIn this regard, the best way to make the break easier is to make your open side throws seem even more threatening than your break throws. If you can continue to deal out devastating throws on the open side, a mark will eventually start to inch over to hinder this option in an attempt to create a turnover opportunity. When this happens, the defender has exposed the weak side and you should have an easy break option.\n"

  "content": "There are some basic concepts that everyone talks about to effectively break the mark:\nuse your core to stay balanced while you fake and pivot to get your marker off balance; learn to fake and throw/release at different heights; engage your marker by drawing them closer or moving them side-to-side with your pivots. However, my favourite \u0026lsquo;move\u0026rsquo; to teach, regardless of playing level, is how to redefine your throwing lanes when you have the disc. Put more simply, don\u0026rsquo;t let the marker control your throwing lanes.\nAlmost all players catch the frisbee and then, if they don\u0026rsquo;t throw a continue pass right away, square up with the line of scrimmage irrespective of where the marker sets up. Likely the only adjustment that is made occurs at the sideline when players are often told to keep their behind to the sideline. But that adjustment is a general concept that can be used anywhere on the field.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start with the disc on the sideline example. When a thrower close to the sideline stands with her bum to the sideline instead of square with the line of scrimmage, she automatically shifts the throwing lanes to facilitate an easier dump pass to get the disc off the sideline. If marker shifts position in response, the thrower now has the upper hand and is dictating what/where the throwing lanes are and where she can throw. Doing the same thing away from the sideline often produces remarkable results. If the mark is forcing one- way, the thrower should square up to the marker instead of the line of scrimmage. In doing this, the thrower has now shifted the field and created different throwing lanes - the thrower is now playing the mark more straight- up. The inside-out throw looks more like a regular open-side throw and that step-around doesn\u0026rsquo;t really look like a step-around break anymore but looks more like another open-side throw. With a flat mark, the thrower should try turning his hips one direction or the other, so that they aren\u0026rsquo;t square with the marker and see what happens.\nWhatever the mark, don\u0026rsquo;t simply square up to the line of scrimmage. Set yourself up so that you take control of your throwing lanes. And you might find that you never really seem to throw a \u0026lsquo;break mark\u0026rsquo; throw\u0026hellip;\n"

  "issue": "013",
  "content": "It can be easy to make excuses for not playing team defense in Mixed Ultimate, especially in man-to-man set-ups. About half the people on the field you would never choose to mark up on/cover prior to the pull, the people you want to set up switches with may not be the closest people to you, and the person in the best position to help you might not be the obvious choice given the situation. However, with practice and communication, there\u0026rsquo;s no reason why skills such as poaching, switching, and being heads-up in general can\u0026rsquo;t be incorporated into a defense\u0026rsquo;s repertoire.\nUnfortunately, there are no strict rules for teaching these skills since the configuration of genders on the field is so unpredictable and ever-changing; also, a person\u0026rsquo;s thinking will often have to shift from moment to moment between guarding one\u0026rsquo;s person, guarding one\u0026rsquo;s gender, and knowing when to help out regardless of gender. It can be a lot to process and therefore becomes more a function of being able to react dynamically, which is, in larger part, based on a person\u0026rsquo;s/D-team\u0026rsquo;s experiences. Therefore, while theoretical explanation can help foster understanding of the basics, honing the skills is best done via real or simulated game situations.\nA LITTLE THEORY\u0026hellip;\nLow Risk/High Reward Poaching\nOne of the easier poaching strategies to master in Mixed is a woman poach in the lane off of the woman handler. Often times, this offensive position will stay behind or around the disc and so a poach will never be too far from putting a mark on. The biggest advantage to this poach is that, if done properly, she can cut off the in-cuts, which means that the downfield defenders can back a little, thus the out-cuts are also covered. Then when the disc goes to the woman handler, the downfield defense can adjust to covering the in-cuts since this is generally the more dangerous part of the field at that point. The challenge for the poacher is to position herself so that she can see where the cuts are coming in while also keeping track of where the thrower is looking. Sideline talk can help her be in the right place at the right time. This D can be especially effective given adverse weather conditions and can be a way to switch up the D from zone to man so that the offense doesn\u0026rsquo;t get too comfortable with one particular look.\nPrepare for Switching to Make the D\u0026rsquo;s Job Easier\nSwitching can take several different directions in Mixed. Although there are times when there is switching between genders, it is usually out of momentary necessity (i.e. zone O to man D transition) and looks to be resolved as quickly as possible since those are probably not the match-ups you are hoping for. However, switching within a gender leads to more equitable match-ups, can be planned for, and can be used to make defense easier and help save your legs a bit.\nBeing able to prepare for switches with players of your own gender depends on how the offense sets up and how quickly they get going. If there are two people of your gender in the stack, one defender could cover the in-cut and one could cover the out-cut. If there are three people of your gender in the stack, you could set up an in/out/middle or an in/out/break (this one is great around the endzone where there is less field to cover on the force side and a break side throw could lead to an easy score). The thing to remember is that the genders are probably spaced out in different places in the stack and so you have to keep an eye on what all the cutters of your gender are doing and continue to communicate with your teammate(s) when your wo/men start making their moves.\nSwitches become slightly trickier when the offense is in a split or ho stack. With the split stack, unless two of your gender are set up on one side of the field (in which case you could set up in/out), preparing for switches probably isn\u0026rsquo;t possible. And with ho stack, the spacing between offensive players is probably greater than with a straight stack so, again, unless two of one gender are next to each other to provide an in/out set up opportunity, switching could prove to be more trouble than it\u0026rsquo;s worth (although it might be worth a try anyway to see for yourself—defensive points are the times to take chances). What it comes down to is being aware of where the genders are set- up, what opportunities for switching, if any, that provides, and then communicating intensions with your teammates.\nBe Heads Up and Go Get It If You Can\nOne mentality that needs to be avoided in Mixed is the one where a defender thinks s/he should only go for a disc that is meant for someone of his/her own gender. If you are in a position to make a bid on a disc, do it. This means knowing where the disc is, where the intended pass is going, and gauging the risk of leaving your person relatively undefended (if the situation calls for it). Probably the most advantageous places on the field for one to be heads up are the front of the stack, last in the stack, and as the person clearing out of the lane. The first person in the stack can keep an eye out for the quick, straight pass up the middle; the last person has to be aware of the deep shot; the defender clearing out of the lane can see the next cut coming in and can intercept the pass to that cut if the timing is right. I\u0026rsquo;ve found that one of the more fun things about being a woman in Mixed Ultimate is being underestimated. Sometimes you can make that work for you and get your team turns in the process.\nAND A LOT OF PRACTICE\nProvide Opportunities for Collective Learning\nTeam D is all about knowing each other and working together and for that you mostly have to learn together. So your aim as a team should be to get your D exposed to as many different situations and conditions as possible. In terms of practice time, 10-pull or some variation of it is a great \u0026ldquo;drill\u0026rdquo; because it lets the defense work together more intensely than a simple scrimmage would. Controlled scrimmage, such as a game to 5 with play stoppage, can also be valuable for real-time pointing out of where people are and where they should be for more efficient and effective defense. Then of course it is also extremely important to try some of these things out on people who don\u0026rsquo;t have the inside track to what you\u0026rsquo;ve been working on. Worthwhile pre-series tournaments, as many as you can get your team to, are imperative for D-team development. A brief huddle after certain D points where the line can discuss positives, negatives, and adjustments will help to increase their collective learning.\nCommunicate, Communicate, Communicate!\nTeam D isn\u0026rsquo;t just about the 7 people on the field; it\u0026rsquo;s also about the other 10-20 on the sideline. True team D gets them involved as well. It is at times impossible for a single defender to see everything s/he needs to see in order to play the best D and so having another member of your team in your ear from the sideline for the duration of the point is invaluable. From the line before the pull, a defender should pick an available teammate from the sideline to talk to him/her and it is that person\u0026rsquo;s responsibility to follow the defender and let him/her know what is going on elsewhere on the field that would effect how one plays D (i.e. who has the disc, where the disc is, where the thrower is looking, where the cuts are going, etc.). Regardless of what kind of D you are playing, communication on the field and from the sideline is a must. The best communication comes from familiarity with each other\u0026rsquo;s voices, which is why being vocally active in everything from a basic endzone drill to sideline encouragement helps make sure that communication comes more naturally and will be there when it matters most.\n"

  "content": "I\u0026rsquo;ve had some success teaching team D in the past, and I like to think that young players, especially bright ones, will often surprise you with their ability to learn complex concepts and make them work against very good offensive players and teams.\nOne example of our team-D philosophy is in how we taught dump D at U of Oregon. This would usually happen at some point during February or March, after the basics of defense and offense but before the real tournament schedule got up to speed.\nWe\u0026rsquo;d talk/walk/run through three aspects of dump D. For each aspect, we\u0026rsquo;d talk as a team, most often using a couple of people as human models. My experience tells me that people learn only rarely from whiteboards. If you want them to apply something on the field, you have to show them on the field. We\u0026rsquo;d discuss the logic first (\u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; are we doing this) and then the tactics.\nAs often as possible, we\u0026rsquo;d do a drill where everyone was in a group, and we went through a specific motion together. Wax on, wax off, only we are \u0026lsquo;poach on, poach off.\u0026rsquo; This works really well for individual techniques like marking, as well.\nThe three aspects we\u0026rsquo;d talk/demonstrate/drill/attempt for dump D were:\n1. Body positioning\nWe give our players the option of forcing the dump upfield, backfield, face- guarding, or watching only the thrower (space-guarding). The logic for each is given simply:\nFace-guard when you want to prevent the throw entirely, and no one else is a threat. Force backfield when yardage is crucial (like, they are going upwind). Force upfield when we want to pressure the thrower or the handler. Space-guard when you think you can get a block, or to poach and force a thrower to give up the disc. (We\u0026rsquo;d demonstrate each tool that the defender has, and practice each briefly on a slo-mo D to get the sense of body positioning.)\n2. Changing the focus\nPoaching is often more effective early, when throwers won\u0026rsquo;t give up the disc. Changing from force-back to force forward can disrupt timing. Great throwers should be give fewer open looks, if possible. Perhaps most effectively; giving a certain player a different look can keep them thinking, and prevent them from establishing a rhythm.\nCrucially; this is the point at which we discuss working together with the mark. Choosing an appropriate focus based on the mark is very useful, and can give us blocks. This is where the team D aspect comes in; the dump defender was allowed to ask for a different mark or a different tendency from the mark, so that this becomes a 2v2, instead of a 2v1 against the dump defender.\n3. Frame the competition\nThis was absolutely important for us; we had to give our defenders (most often our inexperienced players, if they were learning this for the first time) an expectation of what they were supposed to accomplish. In this scenario, we tell our players that a dump is a 95% throw, and that if they can force a turnover on 2/20 dumps, they are winning their battle by a large margin. They should expect to give up completions, but try to keep those completions off- rhythm, difficult to execute, and occasionally pick off a throw (and then go to the house for the fast-break goal!).\nI definitely do not write this to say that this is the best way to play dump D; but rather as an example of how we taught team defense (at least in this fairly specific example).\n"

  "issue": "013",
  "content": "I think there are two skills that can take a player from a good defender to a great defender and they both have to do with the transition from an individually good defender to a good team defender.\n1. Communication. Silent defenders will never be great defenders. This includes \u0026ldquo;up,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;switch\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;last back\u0026rdquo; calls. This is particularly important in zone defense for wings and deeps. To practice this, I sometimes require players to be saying something continuously during a defensive drill. This helps generally quiet folks get over the hump of being vocal on the field. This skill also holds true for people talking from the sideline. To practice sideline talk have a thrower pivot while a marker marks with her eyes closed and someone talking from the sideline. By doing this, the marker will learn to listen and the sideline talker will learn to puppeteer the marker.\n2. Vision. This can be harder to teach—some people are born with field sense or learn it in other sports and some just don\u0026rsquo;t have it. However, this can be practiced in concert with skill #1 by doing lots of 2-on-2 drills or 2-offense-on-1-defense drills. This forces the defender to be aware of more than just her offender. Erring on the side of fronting in one-on-one matchups and then relying on the sideline for an up-call is a great way of practicing the transition from individual to team defense—finding the disc after an up call (no matter where it was thrown) is an upper-level skill that most good defenders can always work on to become great defenders.\n"

  "content": "Team defense begins with an understanding and analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of your team\u0026rsquo;s defensive talents, followed by the development of defensive philosophies that are executed by specific team-oriented strategy. Too often, \u0026ldquo;team defense\u0026rdquo; is taught in terms of situational defensive sets such as zone, clam, poaching, and whatnot with an over-reliance on individual athleticism to play man-D. While high-flying layout blocks are at times warranted and necessary, it appears the spectacular has come to define a team\u0026rsquo;s defensive prowess along with foot-races and gravity-defying leaps. Rather than focusing on improving individual D (with a run harder, jump higher, and spit further mentality), teaching broader defensive concepts can help a player step up both their own and their team\u0026rsquo;s D by seeing the field better.\nOne way to think about it, is to have players answer the questions \u0026ldquo;where and how is the team going to get a turn?\u0026rdquo; This team defense philosophy shifts the onus from the individual player creating and getting a block to the team generating opportunities for everyone to get turnovers and, in theory, increasing the chances of any player on the field to earn a D. Obviously when the opportunity arises, the individual(s) must still make the defensive play but the overall strategy relies on the entire team creating specific outcomes. Instead of the \u0026ldquo;play hard man D\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;run harder and faster than the O and get a block\u0026rdquo; motto, the underlying tenet is that turnovers are created when the D forces the O to do what the D expects, which allows any player on your team to earn/get the turn.\nIn addition to forcing the O to do what the D expects, force the O to choose their second or third or fourth options. The O clearly has an advantage if allowed to play to their strengths, so structure your team\u0026rsquo;s D to expose and exacerbate their weaknesses. Dictate how the O will have to beat you through team D strategies and your team will likely have a better chance of winning—i.e. if you get beat by Rondo hitting pull-up jumpers all night, then tip your hat off to the other team. But if you let The Truth take you down the river then shame on your team D.\nHow does this translate onto the field? Something simple such as forcing one- way (forehand/home) for a point needs to be translated into a systematic team- wide approach. Pit the strengths of your team against your opponent\u0026rsquo;s weaknesses. Evaluate what types of D-players you have on the team and how the O likes to score. One scenario can be if your team is full of short(er) speedy players and you know the O prefers to bomb the disc down the field to score in minimal throws. Thus forcing the O to repeatedly cut under to make them throw more passes is a good start to a team D strategy. But it doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop there as the D can systematically further reduce the offensive options.\nThe team will make sure to disrupt any sort of big throw, so when a marker sees the thrower wind up for huck, she will step-off and be bigger and more straight-up, forcing a less than perfect shot. The marker is also responsible for holding the force but given the throwing talent around today, that isn\u0026rsquo;t always possible. However, this too can be turned into a D-earning opportunity. If the O is going to break your mark, how does that fit into your D-strategy? In the case of forcing a team under repeatedly, the O will be running full steam to the disc on the in-cut so where do you want to generate a block? Do you want the O to try throwing floaty IO\u0026rsquo;s or do you want the O to throw zippy IO\u0026rsquo;s or do you want flat wide step-around backhand break throws and will those be fluffers or zippy? Does the wind affect any of those choices? Does the O run mainly through their handlers? If the lane cutters rarely look up-field, do you want to force the disc into the hands of the lane cutters more often and take it away from the handlers? How does each of these things change the mark? The important thing to note is that the mark isn\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;giving\u0026rdquo; anything but making sure that if they are broken, it will be by a certain type of throw that the entire team will expect and can either deny and/or contain. At this juncture, the team D strategy has now defined which lanes and spaces the downfield D will control and clog, what throws are expected, and as a result, when and how a turnover can be achieved.\nObviously, this is just one over-simplified scenario of forcing one way, but it demonstrates the types of questions that the entire team needs to be able to answer and that team defense is a general philosophy and not only applicable to fancy defensive sets.\nAs a final note, team D is firmly ensconced in the concept of deny and contain D. First deny the disc to the O-player but if the disc goes up and the D isn\u0026rsquo;t 150% sure about getting the block, then he switches immediately to containment mode. This means the D-player no longer goes for the block but now works hard to get into position to ensure the designated force is put on the early on the imminent thrower. How many times have we seen a team break the force and the disc move quickly up the broken side for an uncontested score? Or how many times have we seen someone whiff a diving block or lunge past the disc thus giving the thrower an uncontested look downfield?\nThe beauty of team D is that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t rely on just a few individuals on your team to either get blocks or shut down specific people on the O. You don\u0026rsquo;t want to rely on individuals to win you games since you just don\u0026rsquo;t know who will get injured or who will simply have a bad day. As one of the smartest and most successful players once said—someone always blows a knee at Nationals but if you have a team philosophy and strategy, that won\u0026rsquo;t kill your chances of winning. Don\u0026rsquo;t screw your teammates, follow the plan of attack, and more often than not, you\u0026rsquo;ll get the turnover you want.\n"

  "content": "Rich \u0026ldquo;Farmer\u0026rdquo; Hollingsworth once said that when a team is on offense, seven people is too many (a crowd), but when a team is on defense, seven isn\u0026rsquo;t enough. Communication is the extra player, and it\u0026rsquo;s the key to successful team defense. For team defense, I don\u0026rsquo;t think that there is a more important skill or a more simple one. It\u0026rsquo;s also hard to develop and I have always found it to be really difficult to teach. It\u0026rsquo;s especially difficult for players who are either new on a team or just on the cusp of becoming elite.\nProbably every team at some point when in a huddle has talked about the importance of talking on the field, the importance of the players not on the field being \u0026lsquo;part of the game\u0026rsquo; and about different things to say during the game. The cliché statements often don\u0026rsquo;t work. There are only two things I have found that work, and even then I can\u0026rsquo;t promise success.\nThe first is be specific in what you expect to be said. Telling people to talk without telling them what to say doesn\u0026rsquo;t work. As an example, think about the offensive calls that your team has. If there\u0026rsquo;s a turnover, as the handler is picking it up, teams will often make a play called that defines what most of the players on the field do. \u0026ldquo;Yellow thirty-seven five puppy\u0026rdquo; On defense, you\u0026rsquo;ll only hear part of it. \u0026ldquo;Force flick.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s a start. But, if you add more specific things to say, then even the most reticent player will probably use it. \u0026ldquo;Strike\u0026rdquo; probably sounds familiar, and most people know that this means to stop the throw up the force side (usually on the line) for a second. Define terms for your team to use that have very specific meaning. Next, define what the person who hears the call is supposed to do. \u0026ldquo;On a strike call, the mark goes flat for 2 counts.\u0026rdquo; Now you\u0026rsquo;re playing team defense. \u0026ldquo;Switch\u0026rdquo; is another call that you\u0026rsquo;ve heard. It\u0026rsquo;s meaning is pretty obvious—but even these \u0026lsquo;obvious\u0026rsquo; calls should be clarified. \u0026ldquo;If you are last in the stack, and a player calls switch, you do it. Period.\u0026rdquo;\nTwo quick asides: (1) I don\u0026rsquo;t want this to discourage players from saying anything. Any piece of information is useful, so you can\u0026rsquo;t only focus on specific calls. I watched a player turn and get a D last weekend because one of his teammates got beat and communicated that he had been beat. What did the player yell? \u0026ldquo;Oh s***!\u0026rdquo; It worked. (2) The things that you say don\u0026rsquo;t have to be too complicated or secret. It\u0026rsquo;s more important that your team understands what it needs to do than it is for you to hide it from your competition.\nThe second thing that I\u0026rsquo;ve found works is to do it. You can\u0026rsquo;t tell people to talk, and then stand on the sideline looking at the sub sheet between points. You can\u0026rsquo;t tell people to talk on the field and then cover your person without saying anything. Leadership and example goes a long way.\n"

  "content": "Team defense starts when you can make solid assumptions about what your teammates will and will not allow. A good team defense limits the offense\u0026rsquo;s options to looks that the D is prepared for, and then pounces when the O predictably does what you set them up for. Basically, you can\u0026rsquo;t play team defense if you are purely reactive to the offense—you have to have a general goal for how you are going to manufacture turnovers.\nThe key to making an offense predictable is to limit the play of handlers. Since handlers are close to the disc, it makes sense that they can change the point of attack faster than downfielders—as in, a quick yardage gainer to a handler changes the viable deep space instantly—making it much harder for downfield defenders to take away both the out and under. Similarly, a first look break by a handler gives the O free yards by attacking where the downfield defenders assume they are protected.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re keeping handlers on the open side and losing yards, the only place downfielders can cut is underneath to the open side. This makes it much easier to switch on D or poach, or generally ball hawk down field. Last year we started with handler D, and we had a lot more success with switches down field, or running stunts that generated blocks.\nMy favorite drill for working on handler D in a flat stack offense is a 3-on-3 drill, with a full width field, with 5 cones 10 yards apart along the sideline. The O starts with the disc in the middle of the first segment. The O can only advance the disc one 10 yard segment at a time, and if they go back a segment, they have to regain that segment again (you can\u0026rsquo;t lose 10, then gain 20, if that makes sense). It\u0026rsquo;s an exhausting drill and can be used as a conditioning drill—but generally, I like to have the whole team watch, cheer and talk to their defender teammates as the drill is being run. This puts more pressure on the defenders, and makes it painfully obvious when they lose focus.\nBefore we start, we talk about:\n1. Preventing the up the line cut with body position.\n2. Winning the first step after each throw.\n3. Stopping the first break look that your person gets if they do get the disc.\n4. Making a \u0026ldquo;Strike\u0026rdquo; call to the marker (stop the open side) if you get beat up the line.\n"

  "content": "At the college level, the dividing line between teams that can generate a break or two, and the teams that consistently go on a run of breaks can be attributed to the concept of team defense.\nMy experience in trying to introduce this concept to new, or inexperienced, players is to break things down to the absolute basics. Initially, during our first chalktalk regarding the defense I like to introduce the name of the D (something catchy, without lending too much information to opponents who might hear it on the sideline), and the main objectives of the defense (forcing lots of short passes, forcing inside out strikes, forcing long, low percentage throws).\nI may show the defense on a chalkboard. for some, it is very useful to move off of the chalkboard and onto the field. I like to place people on the field (or a shortened field) and walk the entire team through each position, and explain what the contribution of each position is to the team-D concept.\nAfter fielding questions (taking special care not to get into a flurry \u0026ldquo;What if?\u0026rdquo; questions) we run the defense against a 70%-speed offense. After 5-10 minutes of reps, we go 100% live. This is the usual time for things to degenerate, or objectives lost due to competitiveness, so it\u0026rsquo;s very important to ensure that the reps are not rushed, and are re-focused with the team defense concept in mind. This is also a great time for people to experiment at different positions to get a feel for where their strengths lie in this particular team D.\nIf there are still troubles with results, objectives, or simple understanding, I find it very useful to bring a whistle and explain that during the reps if the whistle is blown, everyone freezes. While frozen, I ask various positions what thoughts they have at the current time-frame (Are you in the right spot with regard to the nearest offensive player? What are you planning to do next to move the offensive flow in the direction of our concept? And so forth).\nThis basic teaching formula has been very effective in teaching beginning and intermediate players some of the more advanced concepts of team defense. As an added bonus, these positional concepts also condition them for advanced concepts of man-to-man defense.\n"

  "content": "Understanding that each player is an integral part in the defensive machine precludes all other aspects of defense. Getting everyone on the same page is of utmost importance as 6 players playing together and fulfilling their responsibilities does not equate to a block. So, this is the initial step in teaching team defense.\nFrom here, it is a matter of understanding the defense we are running (zone, man, clam, junk, etc.) and the duties of each player in the defense thereafter. It is also important to understand the purpose of the defense. Is it containment-based or high-risk-high-reward? What are we taking away and what are we giving them? Questions of this order are important because they give each player an understanding of the overall objective and their personal responsibility.\nFor example, you can play man defense with a one-way force, but do you want the downfield cutters to be pushed away, under, both?\nFrom here, I would set up an offense and put a defense on them, and walk through the different forces/defenses and what they give and take away from the offense. Let the defense see what the offense sees, what options are available and which are not, and what options are more rewarding to the offense than others. After walking through, let the two teams play for sometime and try things out. Give them a chance to see what works and what doesn\u0026rsquo;t, and improvise a little.\nAfter they played for a while, I would bring it in and let the two teams talk about what they found to work and what didn\u0026rsquo;t. This would lead into drills, which would emphasize these specific traits. For example, if we were working on forcing straight up and having the downfield cutters push their guys out, I would run a drill with a 1-on-1 cutting situation where the cutter has 5-stall counts to get the disc, getting rewarded for beating the defender under, nothing for getting the disc long, and defender getting rewarded for a block.\nIf the team is working well and understanding everything, I would then move on to try and show switching and poaching; I would not introduce this, however, unless they were confident with the defensive tactics up to this point.\nSwitching and poaching can be extremely useful and advantageous, but only under the confines of a well-executed team defense. The advantages of poaching or switching are nullified if the defense is not playing together as a single unit; ie a well-timed switch or poach with everyone on the same page can lead to a team block, however, a well-timed switch or poach without everyone together can lead to a quick offensive point.\n"

  "content": "Goal line cutting starts with decisiveness and ends in glory—either for your or your teammates.\nWhen your team moves into its red zone offense, begin by moving quickly into position. Your speed getting into position will determine whether they are going to stay with you or leave you and poach the lane. When you sprint to your attack point, your defender will instinctively feel like you are a threat and attempt to stay with you. If you jog into position, a good defender will take this opportunity to evaluate the field and put himself or herself in a position to make a play.\nAfter reaching your attack point, take a jab step, give a head fake, do something unpredictable to keep your defender\u0026rsquo;s attention while you evaluate the field and decide the best plan of attack. Make a decision, and execute it.\nBy making your cut hard, you are clearing space for your teammates and attracting the attention of not only your defender, but likely other defenders around you, making it easier for the rest of the offense to get open. If you get looked off, clear hard back into the stack to again create space for your teammates. If your defender stays in the lane, take advantage and either go to the break side of the field or attack the middle of the field and get the disc in a powerful position.\n"

  "title": "Exploiting Defensive Adjustments",
  "author": "Nick Handler",
  "issue": "012",
  "content": "When you transition from open field cutting to goal-line cutting, two major things change: (1) you are no longer a deep threat, and (2) a throw that gains only a few yards can be very advantageous. Both of these factors change how the defense will play you. For instance, many defenders will get closer to you, get physical, and perhaps force you away from the thrower with their body position.\nThere are ways to exploit these defensive adjustments as a cutter. Here are a couple of general approaches that I use to help my team score goals in endzone O:\n1. Spacing\nSpacing in both the vertical and horizontal directions of the field are key as you set up your endzone cuts. Initiating cuts with a good amount of vertical separation from the thrower allows you to use forward momentum to put your defender on his heels. This is often necessary when defenders are aggressively fronting near the endzone. If you can get your defender backpedaling, you can take advantage of the small buffer he is giving you and possibly beat him to the open side with a good jab step or hip fake - giving your team the easiest possible throw for a score. In terms of horizontal spacing, setting up your cut slightly on the open side gives you and the thrower the most options - open side, IO break, around break. If you read the defender and see that he is very afraid of getting beat to the open side, you can exploit his positioning by cutting back towards the break side for an easy \u0026ldquo;up-the-gut\u0026rdquo; throw. Or you can remain stationary and let your thrower put an easy space throw to the break side if that is one of his strengths. If your defender is overplaying the break throw, you can still go to the open side from that position.\n2. Explosive and decisive cuts\nExplosive and decisive cuts near the endzone will force your defender to commit to one direction, turn his hips, and possibly overpursue, all of which will allow you to change direction and gain separation for an easy score. In contrast to an open field cut where you may set the cut up by getting up to full speed in the opposite direction, effective endzone cuts only need one hard jab step, a shoulder fake, and a quick and decisive change of direction to create separation. Many times you won\u0026rsquo;t even have the time or the space to set up a longer cut.\nMiscommunication due to indecisive endzone cutting is a common cause of redzone turnovers. As a cutter, you need to work hard to create separation for a throw that your thrower is comfortable with, commit 100% to this cut, and let the thrower do the rest. Be decisive and you will help cut down on many unnecessary turnovers.\n3. Give-and-go and upline cuts\nThe deep space is almost useless in endzone O (except for a hammer look), so attacking the endzone from behind the disc or with a give-and-go is an effective way to score. However, this needs to be part of a larger team strategy to avoid clogging and confusion.\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be a secret that you are going to try to beat your defender for the score in endzone O. In fact, indicating to the thrower and your teammates that you are in a good position to score either verbally or with a raised hand will allow them to give you the space and time you need to make a goal-scoring cut. Once you have this space, you can use the tactics discussed above to help you score the goal. Finally, quickness is one of the most advantageous physical traits in endzone offense. Often times getting that single step of separation is all you and the thrower will need to score. Train to improve the quickness of your first step and you will be a much bigger threat by the endzone.\n"

  "content": "Really, long points are earned at practice and at the track, well before the specific moment arrives on a Sunday afternoon.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s hard for me to think about being a successful endzone cutter as a personal achievement. More than any other position on the field, having the disc near the goal line requires a full team effort to create a good scoring chance. Stack discipline and spacing are crucial to avoiding clogged lanes and disruptive picks. In such a condensed space, it is rare to find an open, easy throw. Still, when your team needs a score on the next one, there are a couple things the cutter can do to take some of the pressure off of the thrower.\nJust like in any other position on the field, the easiest place for a thrower to put the disc is into space. Forcing your teammate to gun a disc into a tight spot is the last thing you want when fatigue is affecting throwing mechanics and decision-making. Especially when fatigue may also be affecting your ability to snag an imperfect throw. Part of this means knowing which throws your teammate is comfortable with. Maybe this thrower really prefers their backhand to their flick, even if it means going around a mark. Or maybe they are much more confident throwing inside-out than outside-in. You should know this about this about your teammates; your defender might not.\nA much larger part of this skill is setting up your cuts with some kind of fake. Running directly toward your defender with a straight cut from the back of the stack toward the front cone rarely allows you to create any real separation. Instead, you need to find a way to put your defender on their heels and then cut away from them into space.\nWhen I\u0026rsquo;m preparing to cut, in my mind I like to split the endzone into quadrants: open side-front, open side-back, break side-front, break side-back. At any given time, only two of the four quadrants are going to be available to me as a cutter. My position in the stack and the position of the disc on the field dictate which two. When the disc is within a few yards of either sideline, I want to completely ignore the far side; any cut there requires a throw either over the stack or across the long face of the goal, both extraordinarily risky given the current circumstances. When the disc is in the middle of the field, most goals are going to be thrown to the front half of the endzone, rather than with tougher bendy, floaty passes to the back corners. Knowing where to cut and where it is easy for your teammate to throw is another huge step in creating a good scoring chance.\nNow, two specific cuts that can help you score in one throw. The key to both is being confident, aware that the offense has the advantage of knowing when he or she will cut while the defender has to react.\nStarting from the back of the stack with the disc is near the sideline, everyone on the field knows that ideally you want to get to the front cone. Your defender should have planted himself or herself directly in your way to that objective. If you have a mismatch and your quickness allows you to get to that spot before your defender, more power to you. If not, force them in toward the cone, then plant and cut toward the back cone. Maybe your thrower has the bendy around throw to the back. Or, you can clear out toward that back cone and allow the next person in the stack take a much shallower approach to the front of endzone for a \u0026ldquo;gut cut.\u0026rdquo;\nAlternatively, when the disc is in the middle of the field and you are at the front of the stack, my favorite cut is basically equivalent to a buttonhook play in football. Take five or six hard steps straight to the open side, plant and take two steps back toward the stack. Your thrower now has a straight throw on the force side while your defender is caught backpedaling.\n"

  "title": "Know Your Thrower, Make It Easy",

  "issue": "012",
  "content": "When thinking about cutting in the endzone, the first thing to consider is if you even should cut. You have to assess where the space is and the convenience of your angle to that space. You need to know who your thrower is and what they are comfortable with (if you cut to where you intend to cut, will the thrower have the throw to hit you accurately enough for it to be a score?). You need to know how you fair with your match-up compared to others\u0026rsquo; match- ups. And of course you need to be aware of how many people are up field and where and how they are set up, which is likely a function of the kind of play just completed to get you within 5 yards of the endzone.\nIf after this split second assessment you decide that you should in fact cut, your next job is to make it as easy as possible for both you and the thrower. If a handler has possession of the disc, this probably makes your job easier as a cutter because there are more options of places you can go and still be a viable target. Number 1 easy cut: breakside, looking for a leading around break or an inside break in the gut. Number 2 easy cut: from the front of the stack, a few hard steps to the open side with a quick cut back to the center of the field for a short throw right up the middle (this one requires a well spread out stack so that the second person in the stack doesn\u0026rsquo;t find his/her defender tempted to poach).\nIf a non-handler has the disc, you as a cutter will probably have to work a little bit harder to make sure that the target you are providing is as standard as it can be. This means beating your defender to the open side outright. Run straight at your defender and erase their buffer as quickly as possible, make one juke/stutter step, and sprint right past them on their inside shoulder while they are on their heels. Getting rid of the buffer quickly is really the key because the longer they are able to keep the buffer, the less room you have until the end of your cutting lane and the less likely it will be that you will be open or in the endzone once you are finished with your cut.\nIn my experience, the overall best thing a team can do when it comes to cutter set up in the redzone/endzone is get in a nice spread out, straight stack down the middle of the field. From here, you have the most options for different people to get open from various places in the stack and the person with the disc can make the call of what s/he wants to see. And even if you want to make it quick and painless to score, sometimes the best thing to do is still to dump it, either because it puts the disc in better hands, because it can be easier to cut from movement than stagnation, or because high stall counts can force poor decisions and a reset helps maintain all-around composure.\n"

So, to get open on the open side, I usually start facing the thrower, juke hard toward the defender (they are on their heels), take a few steps really hard to the break side (this usually lures the off-balance defender to commit to the break side), then explode past them to the open side (this may require some stepping past/running through limbs of your defender). Try to add angle to the final cut so you\u0026rsquo;re not cutting directly at the sideline—give your thrower a bigger window with an angle at the front or back cone.\n"

  "issue": "012",
  "content": "From an elementary basketball analogy (sorry readership to those that know a lot about basketball), if everyone is doing their job, the point guard is keeping the ball alive and getting it into the post when available for the forwards and center to finish off. Much like this, in open field, the handlers are keeping the disc alive and looking to get it to the cutters whenever available. To this end, the cutters are the primary workhorses during this phase of the offense by getting the big gains and opening up the downfield. Once the disc is within the red zone, it is then time for the handlers to earn their keep.\nBack to the beginning, as a cutter, I am getting into my position in the endzone structure my team uses (vertical or horizontal) as quickly as possible to get my legs/breath back. I am assuming of course that we don\u0026rsquo;t have a fastbreak opportunity or offensive advantage in running the disc quickly. Now, most teams I have played with like to use some sort of endzone play to score as it seems, and can be, effective. However, this is likely to correlate to something pretty or conventional. Pretty usually entails a dump-swing followed by some options from cutters followed by another dump-swing and repeated. Now, I am tired so my cut is unlikely to be at 100% which makes it more difficult to get open, let alone, there is a not-too-small probability that if I do get open, there will be a poach. This leads to me becoming more tired, and the endzone offense taking longer to score, which is contrary to my initial hope and team goal of an efficient endzone offense.\nLets look at this mathematically speaking (extremely simplified but hopefully understandable). Assume:\nProbability of completed dump or swing = 95%\nProbability of completed upfield throw = 90%\nLet\u0026rsquo;s also assume that these events are independent of one another, and an upfield throw equates to a score.\nNow, our \u0026ldquo;pretty\u0026rdquo; offense dumps and swings, and that option isn\u0026rsquo;t on so we dump-swing again and then get an upfield option, the probability of this endzone offense scoring is:\n(.95)(.95)(.95)(.95)(.9) = .733 probability of scoring.\nIf our endzone doesn\u0026rsquo;t score on that dump-swing, and has to go again, that makes probability of scoring equal to .666.\nSo, our pretty offense can quickly lead to a turn with our tired cutters, which will make our cutters even more tired once we get the disc back due to their previous defensive responsibilities.\nBack to the original topic, I have gone to my position quickly to rest and watch the offense. Instead of sticking to our pretty offense where I might make a power cut on my turn to cut, I am going to rest and wait. I will let the handlers earn their keep as I said before by letting them move the disc quickly and get the defense shifting around. Then, once I see a thrower I know well, and have a connection with, get the disc with his defender tailing or out of position, I will look to make my move. I will look to see where my defender\u0026rsquo;s momentum and the thrower\u0026rsquo;s defender\u0026rsquo;s momentum is going, consider what my thrower is willing to throw and what he prefers to throw, and try to match all of these conditions.\nBy this I mean, find the space in the endzone, opposite my defender\u0026rsquo;s momentum, that opens up the throw my handler prefers to use (no matter how ridiculous or unconventional).\nPersonally, my favorite endzone is a vert stack that is stacked 1/3 of the width away from open side sideline, leaving 2/3 of the width of the field breakside, and letting the handler throw a scoob, high release, or low release into that space for any cutter to run onto.\nBack to our (extremely simplified) mathematical analysis, if you choose the throw the handler prefers (which should increase probability of success) then this can lead to a higher probability of scoring in a more efficient manner, which is what the cutter wanted from the beginning.\nSo, this isn\u0026rsquo;t pretty, but can get the job done in a more efficient manner with an equal to higher percentage of scoring. Assume:\nProbability of getting disc to middle of field = 95%\nProbability of unconventional throw into endzone = 85%\n(.95)*(.85) = .8075 probability of scoring.\nIn conclusion, as a cutter, I want an offense that is extremely efficient so I don\u0026rsquo;t have to risk a turnover and more running, let alone, I want to score in as little effort as possible for my sake and my teams. Letting the disc get to the middle and then giving the handler room and time to break the mark makes it easy on me as a cutter, and is a throw we practice time and time again.\n"

  "content": "The following is a couple of thoughts from a handler/team perspective, which isn\u0026rsquo;t exactly what we asked our authors to write about (but we thought it appropriate to add in here). I first wrote this article in 2004, in response to this comment on rec.sport.disc:\n\u0026gt; \u0026gt;scoring in the endzone is easy. just break the mark.\nYes, this will probably work most of the time. I think that the intrinsic difficulty in End Zone O is the pressure on the offense to score; the idea that \u0026ldquo;most of the time\u0026rdquo; isn\u0026rsquo;t good enough. If you throw a huck out the back, you don\u0026rsquo;t sit there and mope, but for some reason there is a dissapointment in coming away from the goalline without a point. We notice end zone turnovers more: this is why End Zone O seems difficult.\nWe also demand more of our EZO; a 60% scoring rate is not acceptable in high- level play. We need to continue to find ways to score 9/10 goals, not just find ways to score.\nAbout the \u0026ldquo;Just Break the Mark\u0026rdquo; strategy:\nIf I am on D, I WANT you to have to break a mark to score. If I didn\u0026rsquo;t think my team\u0026rsquo;s mark could stop you, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be playing a forcing strategy. I would be zoning, or playing a straight-up mark, or something where I didn\u0026rsquo;t have to trust my teammate. But I am forcing for a reason- I think my team\u0026rsquo;s mark will get a block, or create a bad throw, enough of the time that my team will score more.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s go ahead and make a break-mark score a neutral play- anytime the offense scores without having to break a mark it is shifting the percentages in the O\u0026rsquo;s favor, and anytime the D forces a particularly difficult break mark, or a difficult throw, or (of course) a turnover, they have won the percentages.\nYou have to think about the endzone in terms of percentage, because in such a short distance, good plays can go unrewarded, and bad plays often work. If your opponent comes out of a goalline timeout, and all they can get is a stall-9 backline layout- you don\u0026rsquo;t want to change how you defended to stop that play. Will that work the other 5 times per game you are in a goalline situation? No, and it probably won\u0026rsquo;t work more than twice. The defense \u0026lsquo;won\u0026rsquo; that play. If you play a team that makes that play 6 out of 6 in a game, you can either adjust your defense to defending a new style of offense that is doing the hardest thing possible, or you can shake their hands and get ready to beat them next time, when those plays inevitably don\u0026rsquo;t work.\nOffensively, you want to score. That means making most of your plays easy, and making up for your mistakes with talent or practice. A method of doing this is to find ways to move the disc a short distance WITHOUT having to break a full mark. Here are 4 ideas.\n1. Establish Doubt in the Downfield Defender\nIf you could get a downfield defender to bite on a break mark throw, the result would be a very easy score on the countering live-side cut. One way to do this is to scare a defender by making the break throw look easier than normal. Many offenses have \u0026ldquo;spread\u0026rdquo; endzone formations, where most of the players are around the outside of the endzone, drawing their defenders away to create a large open space behind one featured offensive player, who is less than 10 yards away from the thrower and centrally located in the field.\nWith so much space behind the reciever, the defender gets anxious about a short hammer or high release. Thrower fakes some such throw, and the defender bites. Results? easy, live side goal. Without breaking a mark.\n2. Make Break Mark Cuts to the Open Side\nSounds weird, I know. Here\u0026rsquo;s how it works. Disc on the goalline, cutter goes hard to the cone. Defender is there, but can\u0026rsquo;t stay right on the cutter as they turn to the dead side. If the thrower waits to break with a throw into space, they have to beat both the cutter and the mark. But, if they can throw it to the cutter before they are on the live side, there is a window that is a live side throw, but a break mark cut, with the defender out of position. This inside lane allows a score without having to break a mark. If the defender can shut it down, they have likely over-pursued the cut, and the cutter can simply go back to the cone, where they will likely be open. Offense wins, without needing to go right at the strength of the D.\nIncidentally, this is usually why \u0026ldquo;Moses\u0026rdquo; plays (splitting the stack and running a cutter up the middle) usually work- the inside lane is tough to mark without giving up a break, and tough to cover if you are more worried about the live-side cone cut.\n3. Get Away From a Mark\na) Throw into space on the dump.\nMoving the disc quickly can get you away from the mark, opening up break side throws without a defender. A simple one: throw a leading throw for your dump into the dead side. The dump runs onto it, and catches it with about 3/4 of a second before the mark gets there. Throw into space on the dead side. Goal. No mark.\nIf the mark did get there, they likely have had to overrun the play, and the inside out lane should be open as they fly by. Goal (although this has the added requirement that cutters have the patience to wait for the throw to space to cut.\nb) Throw the dump to a cutter moving into space.\nPicture it like this: Thrower outside the endzone, forced forehand, with a straight stack. Dump is 2 yards behind, 5 yards wide in the live side. Once the disc gets checked in, simply run the dump to the dead side, flat behind the thrower. Any easy throw to the dump will result in an open second to the deadside. This is exactly like the thrower had taken two steps back away from the mark, and thrown the easy backhand.\nGoal.\nNow your team has scored it\u0026rsquo;s first 4 goals of the game, without breaking a mark, and without anyone having to really work hard to get open. At some point, you are going to need a reciever to get open, or a thrower to make a throw- or you likely will not score the other 11 goals you need. But making 3 or 4 plays easy on you might up your percentages, both on those plays, and on plays where the D has to adjust to stop something tricky you have already done, and weakens their own ability to stop \u0026rsquo;normal\u0026rsquo; offensive plays.\nEndzone Offense SHOULD be easy, and that is exactly why it seems so difficult.\n"

  "content": "Goal line cutting (especially in the elite division) is a difficult technique to master. The fact is, the closer you get to the endzone, the more effective a defensive player can be because you are shortening the field and removing the threat of a deep cut. In general, the offense always has the advantage, but close to the endzone, your advantage as a cutter is lessened.\nAll organized teams usually have a specific endzone offense that they default to when they get within ten yards or less of the goal line. The cutting that I will discuss involves one main cutter engaging the handlers and working with and cutting for them to score the goal. As the main cutter, I have to trust that my teammates (other cutters in the endzone) will occupy their defender, keeping them honest and not allowing them to poach.\nAs the main cutter, I need to know one crucial thing: who are the handlers that I will be cutting for? Playing with teammates throughout the season, you start to learn things about them that help you in these situations. After I survey the field and identify who I will be cutting for, I then want to identify how my defender is playing me. Some defenders like to know where the disc is at all times and position themselves accordingly, while others focus entirely on the cutter and shutting him down. Either way the defender is playing me, I rely on the timing of my cuts to get open and score goals.\nIf my defender is trying to monitor disc location and me at the same time, I will watch his eyes and take advantage of that split second where he loses sight of me. This can lead to goals on the open side as a split second of my defender losing sight of me can turn into a two-yard separation. If the handlers are in a position to get me the disc it is an easy goal. If the handlers are not in a position to get me the disc, even though I was open, I find more often than not, the defender has recognized that I took advantage of his mistake, and then his focus shifts to me entirely and less on disc location.\nIf my defender\u0026rsquo;s focus is entirely on me and not disc location, most of the goals that I score are on the break side. This is where knowing your thrower and their tendencies and abilities comes into play. Initially, I want to position myself closer to the open sideline, which allows for more space to the break side. Then, I usually set up my cut with a jab step to the open side. This gets my defender both on his heels and moving in the opposite direction I intend to cut. After the jab step, I then cut to the break side but only after I have identified who has the disc and what throw to the break side they excel at. If I have timed my cut right, an adequate break mark throw is all that is necessary to score the goal. Because my defender is already on the open side, and I have set up my cut with a jab step, I should have a couple steps to allow the thrower some error and still catch the goal.\nIn my opinion, constant cutting in the endzone usually will lead to bad things: fatigue, high stall counts if you are not open, cutting off throwing lanes to other teammates, and eventually, turnovers. For the most part, I find that timing my cuts properly in the endzone has been the most effective way for me to score goals.\n"

  "issue": "012",
  "content": "The field shrinks when you reach the endzone.\nYour defender no longer has to worry about your deep cuts, and so can front you by a larger margin. The pressure builds- a turnover here in the \u0026ldquo;red zone\u0026rdquo; seems particularly disheartening. All of a sudden, everyone is cutting at once, forgetting about rules and technique, just anxious to get the disc and finish the point.\nHowever, it is precisely here in the red zone that it becomes all the more important to remember your team\u0026rsquo;s strategies and offense. Does your team like to cut from the back of the stack in the endzone? Don\u0026rsquo;t cut off other cutters by flaring out laterally from the front. Does your team look to score from a handler cutting up the line? Don\u0026rsquo;t make a cut from the stack that leaves you hanging out in the front corner.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important that teams have a clear idea of how they want to score in the endzone. For some teams, patient resetting by the handlers will allow star cutters the time they need to set up their cuts. For other teams, the aim might be to get the disc into the hands of their star handler in the middle of the field, and then rely on them to break the mark to whoever is there. Whichever the case, it\u0026rsquo;s important for the cutters to know their responsibility, the cutting patterns they should be running, and most importantly, how they should be clearing!\nOne way of establishing an effective cutting system in the endzone is by having it be position-based: for example, perhaps whoever is at the back of the stack has the priority and responsibility to cut. Everyone else knows not to cut off the cuts coming from the back of the stack. Another way to maintain order in what might otherwise be chaos is to have a player-based system: have a designated scorer whose role is to make cuts in the endzone. This latter technique has several advantages, one being that you can figure out which of your cutters is best at getting open in tight spots (or has the best ability to grab errant throws), and give them priority in the endzone. Another advantage is that you can separate the roles of your cutters such that the designated endzone scorer is not your go-to yardage cutter, and might have fresher legs than the other cutters on the field.\nWhenever people are cutting in smaller spaces, errors are harder to correct for, since the disc is in the air for less time, and there are more defenders in the area. So it\u0026rsquo;s important that your cutting technique leave you as much ability to correct for throwing error as possible.\nFor example, to hit a receiver cutting laterally across the front of the endzone (i.e. when the path of the disc will be roughly perpendicular to the path of the cutter), the thrower needs to place the disc at exactly the right spot- too far in front of them, and the disc will be out of reach, too far behind and the defender will snatch it up. For a receiver coming from the back of the stack, or for a handler cutting up the line to receive a short away pass, the path of the disc is more similar to the path of the cutter, and so that cutter can make small adjustments of their trajectory to compensate for a disc thrown a bit more towards one side or the other. So, once you know that you\u0026rsquo;re the cutter whose role it is to make the cut, it\u0026rsquo;s important to set yourself up in a good position, so that you can make a cut that maximizes your ability to complete the play.\nLastly, a good endzone offense probably either swings the disc back and forth to allow cutters to time their cuts off of a swing, or works on getting the disc into the middle of the field and then trying to keep it there. Try to avoid having the disc stuck on the sideline for too long, as then the usable space for your cutters is even smaller\u0026hellip;unless your endzone strategy is to score off of hammers to the opposite corner.\n"

  "content": "You\u0026rsquo;re downfield, the disc has stopped, and you\u0026rsquo;re defending a cutter in the middle of a flat stack. You\u0026rsquo;ll need all the speed, agility, and strength you have—long before the point begins you can better your odds by improving your physical ability. Chances are if you are reading this you know how.\nAlthough Ultimate is a team game, the flat stack does a good job at isolating one-on-one matchups. While switching and poaching can work against weaker offensive teams, intelligent ones will be able to change the position of both the disc and their cutters quicker than you can react, and will beat your defense without much effort.\nYou aren\u0026rsquo;t reading this to figure out how to guard a one dimensional player—the tall, fast runner who can\u0026rsquo;t throw should be backed (defender closer to the endzone then the disc), and the slow lilliputian thrower should be fronted (defender closer to the disc than the endzone). What you should be worried about are the athletes that can be effective either with the disc in their hands or catching longer throws.\nSo how do you defend them? Frankly, I don\u0026rsquo;t know. After 4 years of club ultimate, I have been beat one way or another by almost every single offensive player. More will get their chance. I have however been taught a few basic tips:\nUnderstand probabilities: A good team will complete all throws to open cutters coming to the disc. These cuts average 10-15 yards, so 5-7 open cuts will mean a goal. Throws to cutters going away from the disc bring a lower completion percentage. Even though one long throw can equal the value of 7 short ones, the chance of a turnover is infinitely better than none. The trick is determining what chance of completion a long throw has, and acting accordingly.\nUnderstand cutter\u0026rsquo;s goals: A cutter with one step separation from their defender coming to the disc is open, however the same cutter with three steps going away is covered. The cutter\u0026rsquo;s differing definition of success should be met with appropriate defensive goals of stopping cuts coming to the disc by more that those going away.\nWatch and match hips: Your cutter\u0026rsquo;s hips will tell you where they are running, and yours should be positioned the same as theirs. When defending your cutter, you need only react to changes of direction by the hips, and not to arm, shoulder, or head fakes.\nKnow the location of the disc: Your position relative to your defender\u0026rsquo;s should also be relative to the location of the disc. You have three choices—watch both your defender and the disc, rely on sideline help to tell you where it is, or (lightly) touch your defender and watch the disc.\nUse your body: It is possible at times to position your body in the path of your cutter before they get there in order to prevent their desired movement. This is particularly effective against cutters coming back to the disc after running away. This is risky, as any cutter can use a overly close defender to their advantage when expected. Never initiate contact.\nThese might help. Remember, perfect offense beats perfect defense. The point is to get as many blocks as possible, which is not the same as stopping every play.\n"

  "content": "If I was teaching a young player to learn to cut from the \u0026ldquo;hot\u0026rdquo; or iso\u0026rsquo;ed positions in the middle of a horizontal stack, I would emphasize a few keys points, which are generally applicable to getting open on a stopped disc within any offensive structure, but are particularly important for a horizontal offense. The points I make are assuming that the defense is not poaching, as cutting against a poaching defense would require a more in-depth discussion of how to run a horizontal offense in general.\nThings to think about when cutting from the iso\u0026rsquo;ed spot of a horizontal offense on a stopped disc:\nThe 45 angle: Position yourself strategically before you start your cut.\nThe success of your cut may be pre-determined just by the way you position yourself. On Fury we talk a lot about using the 45 degree angle (and by \u0026ldquo;we,\u0026rdquo; I mostly mean Sprout [Nicole Beck]). If you set up at 45 degrees from the thrower on the open side, you leave yourself a nice window on the break side to work with. You also put your defender in a tricky positionmdash;if you create enough of a window, your thrower has a pretty easy break option, but obviously your defender can\u0026rsquo;t come all the way over to take it away without giving you the open side. At that point, you have put your defender in a position of having to worry about a number of different possible cuts at once before you have even started moving. The Japanese do an excellent job of using this angle in their cuts and it is very challenging to cover.\nWhat do you want to achieve? Know your role.\nIf you are being put in the iso\u0026rsquo;ed position in a horizontal offense, it is probably for a reason and you should know from your captains or coach what you are expected to achieve. You should also obviously have a sense of your own unique strengths.\nIf you are generally a lot faster than your defender and you are expected to be a deep threat, make sure that you are setting up nice and close to your thrower. A great deep cut can come from setting up on the 45, cutting to the break side, then turning and going deep. Generally if you are iso\u0026rsquo;ed, you should even have enough time to turn and cut under for a gainer if you are covered deep.\nIf you are expected to get the disc and look deep to another isolated cutter, you obviously may want to set up your cut to get the disc underneath. You always want to be flexible as you make your cut (see point #5) but you also want to have an idea as you start your cut of where you want to get the disc. You are on offense and in control.\nWhat is available? Know your thrower.\nKnowing your thrower and their strengths and weaknesses will help you set up the best possible cut. Even if you are an excellent deep cutter, if your thrower is just not comfortable making a deep throw from a standstill, you won\u0026rsquo;t get the disc. In that situation, if you are truly open deep, you won\u0026rsquo;t be in a good position to make an under-cut. At that point, you should clear within the structure of your offense and create space for another cutter.\nAnother common example is that you may know that your thrower absolutely loves her inside out. This will allow you to set up at an even more extreme angle on the open side to set up that inside out cut. As a general matter, the more experienced your throwers are, the more places you will realistically be able to get the disc which will allow you more flexibility/creativity in your cutting.\nIf you are cutting for a thrower who doen\u0026rsquo;t have every throw in her arsenal, you (and your defender) may know that you need to work extra hard to get open coming in on the open side. At that point, you may want to think about trying to set up \u0026ldquo;poor man\u0026rsquo;s break\u0026rdquo; situations by having the thrower dump to another handler on the break side and then look upfield to get it to you.\nFinally, I would strongly encourage you to talk to your throwers and find out what they prefer; don\u0026rsquo;t assume that you already know. I have gotten so much out of having these discussions with my teammates and it has directly translated into better connections on the field.\nWho is guarding you? Know your defender.\nAt any level, it is only to your advantage to watch your opponents and study how they play. If it\u0026rsquo;s a team you play a lot, you may recognize that certain players tend to cover you, and you can study how they play defense. Do they typically over-pursue on hard cuts? Do they poach? Do they make lay out bids? Are they strong in the air? You can also play off your defenders\u0026rsquo; expectations of you if you know they have seen you play. If they have seen you generally catching the disc to set up underneath, it\u0026rsquo;s great to make a serious deep cut early in the game (hopefully coupled with a great deep throw!) to keep them guessing. You can often get at least one free deep or underneath look just based on your defender\u0026rsquo;s expectation of what you normally do.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re a deep cutter, you may find yourself being backed all the time. I think there are two schools of thought on this situation, and it really depends on the offensive structure within which you are working. On the one hand, you may still want to set up as close to the thrower as possible and cut deep to find out if they are really covering you or just standing there. On the other hand, you may be able to drive your defender quite deep just by backing up (back to the importance of positioning before you start your cut) and get a very easy 20 yard gainer right away. Knowing the structure of your offense and your other cutters should help you make this decision, and it\u0026rsquo;s always good to mix it up.\nBe flexible.\nHopefully flexibility is built into your offense. Horizontal offenses can be very creative and dynamic, thus unpredictable, and very difficult to cover. However, on any given cut you will only have a certain amount of time to work. Know within the structure of your offense how long the thrower will be looking at you. Make the most of that time, then get out. Which leads to my final point\u0026hellip;\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t get the disc, create space for good things to happen.\nYour clear can help make the next person\u0026rsquo;s cut successful. Everything you\u0026rsquo;re doing on the field should be intentional.\n"

  "content": "The most important piece to an effective initiation cut is the thrower. To get open, you need to be able to challenge the defender into at least two different places. In the typical flat-stack set, there are three spaces open to the interior cutters: open-side, break-side, and deep. If the thrower can hit all of those spots, getting open is no problem. Fake to one of them, cut to another. Throw, catch.\nThe biggest mistake I see young teams and players make is settling for the open side, come-back cut. This cut is worthless. It gets five yards and a mark on. Why not just leave it in the hands of the initial thrower? Yes, this cut works great against bad teams. It even works great against the freshmen at practice. So what? You need something that works against good defenders.\nHow do you get there? Begin by throwing. Move to drills. Finally, challenge your thrower to break the mark in a scrimmage. Challenge them to huck. They will be terrible at it at first. But through demanding they do it, they will learn. When they have these tools, you have the tools you need to challenge a defender.\n"

  "content": "Cutting from the middle in a horizontal stack is a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, you have the freedom to cut in any direction, your defender is on an island with no deep help, and the offense is looking to you to make a play. Awesome.\nOn the other hand, the flat stack presents some unique challenges for cutters. I\u0026rsquo;m going to focus on the unpredictability of the flat stack as a cutting problem, and explain a couple simple adjustments that address this issue.\nMost downfield cutting happens in flow, off of a moving disc, and not from a stopped position. In a flat stack, cutting opportunities off of disc movement can be sudden and difficult to predict, even for flat stack veterans. In a flat stack, the disc may be thrown downfield from any lateral position on the field, and in many systems the middle cutter(s) will always be the priority target(s). A good opportunity can arise at any time—as soon as a thrower gets the disc with his mark trailing, it\u0026rsquo;s on! There is no easy-to-predict, side- to-side rhythm (like a vert stack dump-swing) that precedes a good cutting opportunity. Additionally, many flat stack offenses operate at a higher tempo than their vert stack counterparts, focusing on rapid disc movement and \u0026ldquo;team offense\u0026rdquo; rather than isolating cutters for extended periods of time. This makes cutting opportunities even more rapid and unpredictable, and also puts more pressure on the cutter to hit the cutting window on-time. If the cutter is open but late, the thrower is already looking to the next option.\nSo, what to do?\n1. Keep your eyes up\nWithout a sure-fire way to predict good opportunities, you have to make sure you see them when they happen. Always be aware of the disc—keep an eye on it much more than you\u0026rsquo;re used to. It\u0026rsquo;s tempting, especially when cutting deep, to put your head down and just churn for a couple seconds—don\u0026rsquo;t do it! Practice cutting deep while you look over your shoulder. This way, you\u0026rsquo;ll be aware when one opportunity ends and where the next begins, and you\u0026rsquo;ll get there on time and before your defender. Cutters who are aware of the disc in a fast-paced offense put enormous pressure on the defense, simply by being the first to see and react to the changing disc position.\n2. Always be preparing\nWhen opportunities are hard to predict, you often won\u0026rsquo;t have time to see a cut, set up and shake your defender, and still get to the cutting window before the thrower is looking elsewhere. The best way to deal with this is to always be preparing to cut. Make short fakes, move evasively so your defender can\u0026rsquo;t get a body on you, make him constantly think about adjusting his position. But do all of this while staying basically in the same place—don\u0026rsquo;t sacrifice your position by committing to one direction on a fake. You need to be ready to cut in any direction, while still keeping your defender off- balance. This takes practice, but it\u0026rsquo;s not hard to learn. Train for quickness and footwork.\n3. Hone your deep game\nThis doesn\u0026rsquo;t really have anything to do with tempo or predicting cutting opportunities, but it needs to be said. The big idea behind the flat stack is the deep threat—it gives all four cutters direct access to the end zone and spreads them out so \u0026ldquo;help\u0026rdquo; defense is harder. If you can\u0026rsquo;t go deep effectively, you\u0026rsquo;re a liability as a cutter. On the other hand, the end zone is always a good place to cut. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know where else to go, go to the house!\n"

  "author": "Chelsea Putnam",
  "issue": "011",
  "content": "I can think of three main points that will help you when you are trying to get open in the middle of a horizontal stack. The first is that your team needs to put the right type of player in that position. In my opinion, this is a player who is confident with the disc, is a threat as a deep thrower, and understands how to get open both going deep and coming under. Having a player who is a \u0026ldquo;threat\u0026rdquo; as a cutter and a thrower will make the defense have to decide what they are going to take away and in doing so will leave more openings for you.\nSecondly, a player\u0026rsquo;s job as a cutter in the middle of the horizontal stack is to engage the defender. This is not a footrace, it is a matter of driving the defender in one direction (my personal favorite is running directly at the defender to get them on their heels and then exploding 90 degrees in either direction). By getting your defender on their heels, even if they are faster than you, you will have a momentary advantage. Also, you will create a better cutting lane for yourself and make it easier to receive the disc. One of the best pieces of advice I ever received is \u0026ldquo;the best in cut is an out cut\u0026rdquo; and vise versa. By driving your defender in one direction it will open up a lane for you in a different direction.\nThe third point is that you need to remember the \u0026ldquo;shoulders square\u0026rdquo; rule. This is the mentality that while cutting, you should have your shoulders facing either directly at your thrower or the thrower should be seeing the back of your jersey. By cutting in with your shoulders square, the width of your body will be in front of your defender, which makes it hard to get a D, and you will be able to move laterally to get to the disc. When cutting out, run in a straight line out (you are fastest that way), check over your shoulder around 8-10 steps (to see if your thrower is still engaged with you), and then decide where you need to go depending on the throw. Typically you will be at least one step in front of your defender (because you knew where you were cutting and they didn\u0026rsquo;t), so after the disc is up you can adjust your position to make the catch. Hopefully those points were helpful because one thing is for sure—horizontal stack is here to stay.\n"

  "author": "Greg Husak",
  "issue": "011",
  "content": "As a defender this is one of the most uncomfortable positions to defend if the stack is well-spaced and with just the right depth to make both the deep cut and the underneath cut a viable option. If the disc is in the middle of the field (say at the brickmark), and your cutter is on the open side of the horizontal stack, there is a lot of space to cover. Unlike with a vertical stack, where two of the four diagonal direction cuts take the cutter behind the mark, in this situation even the cuts towards the closed side of the field are on the open side early in the cut. This forces the defender to have prioritize between all four diagonals, knowing that the mark doesn\u0026rsquo;t have responsibility for any of them.\nIn this situation, well-coordinated movement between the stack positions will inevitably leave a defender vulnerable to a not-too-challenging pass. In this situation the defender has to prioritize the cuts to stop based on his own strengths, the receiver\u0026rsquo;s strengths, wind, team defensive priorities.\nMy priorities, given that I\u0026rsquo;m a bit above average in height, would usually focus on stopping the underneath pass with my positioning, while knowing that I have to go hard if my guy commits to the deep cut and I have to hope that the pass isn\u0026rsquo;t on the money or that I can get some help on a deep throw. This strategy might change if I know that the receiver is a big target for the other team, or has relatively weaker throws, or if our team has been beat by the long ball repeatedly in the game.\nEven though this is an especially vulnerable position for the defense to be in, it also requires some coordinated movement and excellent spacing from the offense to make all options viable. After the first movement it will be come more clear where the hotspots of the offense are, and where my receiver is trying to go. Recognizing these positions early can help you defend more effectively. Also, having defenders in different positions focus on defending different cuts (for instance, the outsides help deep, the insides front) can give the defender some priorities where his help is more defined and his positioning pre-determined.\n"

At its most basic level, you have to recognize the force and figure out which direction your D is trying to push your cut (e.g. towards or away from the disc). The next level is understanding whether your defender is really taking away what her positioning indicates she is. If a defender is caught flat-footed, you can blow by her in a direction, even if she has an initial \u0026ldquo;headstart\u0026rdquo; by positioning herself with a buffer in that direction. Good cutters have developed a series of jukes or moves to help freeze their defenders into the dreaded flat-footed position. An especially easy one to master is driving directly towards your defense to close the distance between you two, making her have to react to small movements like a shoulder fake or stutter step. If you can\u0026rsquo;t get a defender on her heels, you have to get her to commit her hips and momentum in one direction so that you can change directions and gain separtion.\nAgainst even the best defenders, it is important to remember that from any position in the middle of the field there are always at least three different directions to cut and get the disc. To be positioned correctly, there will always be space for in-cuts to both the open and break side as well as deep. Mediocre defenders may take away one of these options and good to great defenders can take away two, but no one can take away everything. Your job as a cutter is to recognize which of your three options is open, position yourself and set-up your cut to maximize the throwing window in that space, and then attack.\nReading the thrower involves both knowing your teammates\u0026rsquo; comfort level with various throws and recognizing the clues from your thrower that communicate when to change direction. Knowing that your thrower doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a long forehand doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that you can\u0026rsquo;t cut to that space, but it does mean that you have to consciously sell that cut (possibly by starting out closer to the disc to make the deep space seem more dangerous) in order to set up another cut underneath. If you are able to set up cuts for the pass the thrower most wants to throw, you are instantly increasing the odds you\u0026rsquo;ll get hit as soon as you are open.\nAt some point or another, everyone has probably seen a thrower point to a direction she wants her receiver to cut to. That\u0026rsquo;s one way for a thrower to communicate with a cutter, although not the most effective. I am a big proponent of using disc fakes to simultaneously move the mark and communicate for a cutter to change direction. As a cutter in the middle of the horizontal stack, if I\u0026rsquo;m cutting in one direction and see the thrower fake that throw, I know she wants me to change direction and she will hit me on my new cut. A cutter needs to work hard to get open on her cuts, but ultimately you are at the mercy of the thrower and if she doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to hit you on a certain cut, you need to change direction to offer up a new angle. Note that some people are not in favor of backhand fakes that require you to pivot. A thrower can still communicate to her cutter with shoulder fakes and wrist snaps without fully pivoting.\nLast, but not least, a cutter needs to read the spaces available on the field based on where her teammates and their defenders are positioned and/or moving. Often the best cut a primary middle cutter can make is to clear space for her teammate to get the disc uncontested. Additionally, often the worse cut someone can make is one where she\u0026rsquo;s gotten open on her defender right into the space where her teammate is also open\u0026ndash;rendering neither of them hit-able. I think that cutting in a vertical stack offense puts a premimum on timing while cutting in a horizontal offense puts a premium on spacing. Know what space you are expected to use for your cuts (likely the middle lane on the field) and know which of your teammates is also expecting to be cutting in to empty parts of that lane as well.\nThe horizontal stack offense allows for a lot of improvisation and creativity on the part of the downfield cutters. Just like in theatrical improv, to be good at it you have to be able to use the cues available to you. On the ultimate field, that includes clues from your defender, the thrower, and your fellow cutters.\n"

  "title": "Advice For Improvement",
  "author": "Kirk Savage",
  "issue": "010",
  "content": "I am writing in about this topic not because I am a great distance thrower. In fact I am quite the opposite. Throwing the disc was something that I did with much trepidation for many years. In fact I was ridiculed constantly by my teammates for not being able to throw a simple backhand (which is why my scoober is a decent throw for me now).\nHowever, over the years I have improved in this area and I do have some advice to pass along to others who struggle.\n1. Practice throwing a ton. But simple practice does not make perfect. I think I remember Wayne Gretzky saying that \u0026ldquo;Perfect practice makes perfect.\u0026rdquo; Get someone to take a look at what you are doing or videotape yourself if need be to make sure you that you are not practicing a flawed skill. Then choose one throw a year that you are going to improve and work on that throw before practice, after practice, and during game play. Make that throw a weapon before you move on to the next. This may mean that you have to play fun tournaments or league in order to find a game where you can play loose and try things out. For me I played ultimate 4-7 times a week for the first six years I played (league, college, and club all at the same time). I still miss my college day\u0026hellip;\n2. Mechanics are very important. This is where everyone does things a little different, but in order to get distance you need power and explosiveness. The power needs to come from a summation of your joints (shoulder, elbow, wrist) as well as a transfer of weight from your legs and hips. Your explosiveness will come from the final snap on the disc (like whipping a towel at your brother). For me, I have found an inside out throw to help me with my longer throws (both forehand and backhand) because I am able to hold onto the disc for a longer period of time. This creates a larger throwing arc and this allows me to generate more power.\n3. Grip—Some people play around with different grips. I use the split finger for forehand (more of a touch throw grip). A popular power grip for the flick is to have two fingers together.\n4. Genetics are key. Some people can just throw things further than others. Shank and MG who I have played with forever can both throw the disc forehand really far. I could practice and train all the time and never be able to out throw either of them.\n5. Drills—Hucking in game situations is always the best way to improve your long game. However I do have a old favorite drill that I used to play with a buddy at the park. This drill is a 1-on-1 game where you are trying to out throw your opponent and force them backwards and out-of-bounds. What you do is you line up about 60 yards from each other with the middle of the park in between the two of you. One player throws the disc as far as they can over their opponent\u0026rsquo;s head. That player then catches the disc as quickly (and high) as they can (trying not to lose yards) and they throw it, trying to gain yards back. If you drop a catch—then you have to take five steps backwards before you huck it. Once a player is forced past a certain out-of-bounds line the game is over. It is tiring, fun, and improves your distance throws and catches.\n6. Confidence—If you think you can throw it a long way, you can. However, if you doubt yourself and are unsure; then you will short arm it, lame duck it, or air bounce it up into the stratosphere.\n"

  "title": "Complete Every Huck",
  "author": "Gwen Ambler",
  "issue": "010",
  "content": "I think a lot of people focus too much on how to throw the disc far rather than on how to complete their hucks. A lot of time, players will spend hours practicing throwing the disc really far, but then they don\u0026rsquo;t make disciplined decisions during a game about when to use those hucks. There are three questions to ask yourself before unleashing any bomb if you want to increase the chances of completing that huck:\n1. Does the cutter have separation? I am a proponent of throwing to separation rather than throwing to match-ups. Sure, how much separation a player needs to be considered \u0026ldquo;open\u0026rdquo; will vary from person to person based on their speed, height, and hops relative to their defender. But the bottom line is that any cutter needs some steps deep on their defender for it to be a good decision to put up a bomb to them. That separation is a cushion that will allow them to get position for any less-than-perfect throw, increasing the chances of completing your huck even if you don\u0026rsquo;t execute your pass quite the way you envisioned it.\n2. Are you adhering to the \u0026ldquo;rule of thirds\u0026rdquo; with this huck? As a cutter, it is easiest to read and catch a huck when you can approach the disc from a different angle than the flight path of the disc. As such, the teams I\u0026rsquo;ve been a part of have emphasized the \u0026ldquo;rule of thirds\u0026rdquo; for setting up hucks. Basically, if you divide the field lengthwise into thirds, for any deep shot either the cutting path of the receiver or the flightpath of the disc needs to cross from one third into another third of the field. If you stick to this rule, you will avoid the temptation of throwing a huck down the sideline to an \u0026ldquo;open\u0026rdquo; cutter who is also cutting down that sideline with a narrow window of opportunity to complete the pass. You will also throw to space more often and give the receiver the maximum time to read the disc, out-maneuver her defender, and attack the frisbee—especially important if the pass wasn\u0026rsquo;t perfectly thrown.\n3. Is the point where the receiver can catch a pass in-stride within your throwing range? Notice, I said, \u0026ldquo;Where the receiver can catch a pass in- stride\u0026rdquo; not, \u0026ldquo;Where the receiver is.\u0026rdquo; Hucks often get underthrown when the thrower misgauges how far away the receiver will be when they\u0026rsquo;ll be making the catch. Just like you want to lead cutters on shorter cuts, you want to be able to lead deep receivers as well. Obviously, increasing the distance you can consistently throw the disc will increase the number of hucking opportunities for which you can answer \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; to this question. Ideally, you want to work on your long throws such that you can put more distance on the disc without needing to think \u0026ldquo;I have to throw this pass really far.\u0026rdquo; Often players' throwing form falls apart when they think they have to do something different to throw the disc farther. When you only throw within your range, you are more likely to be able to execute the pass the way you wanted.\nDrills to practice long throws should be set up in a way to allow the throwers to also practice answering these three questions quickly and accurately, which includes having a defender present on the deep cut.\nWhen working on your throws by yourself in a big open field, practice your throwing mechanics: gripping the disc tightly, staying balanced on your throw, generating torque through twisting your torso and hips, and snapping your wrist as hard as possible. You should imagine a cutter running for each huck as you put it up and then evaluate whether the disc took the flight path and landed where you envisioned.\n"

  "title": "Face A Mark",
  "author": "Jeremy Cram",
  "issue": "010",
  "content": "The most important part of throwing for distance is learning to do so while facing a mark. It\u0026rsquo;s easy for many players to throw 40+ yards unmarked, but when someone\u0026rsquo;s standing in front of you, it becomes much more difficult.\nBegin your backhand motion with your hips and follow through with your shoulder and arm. I\u0026rsquo;m a proponent of bringing the disc straight from the wind- up point to the release point, as opposed to a more arced path. This sort of release will give maximum power and result in I/O or flat throws, which typically make the best hucks. When practicing the backhand huck, try to release the disc before crossing the plane of your body. Developing a quick release will allow your hucks to come off naturally in games. People who release hucks in front of their body will often shortarm hucks, resulting in a crappy throw, or they\u0026rsquo;ll crush someone\u0026rsquo;s face with their follow-through. So, lead with the hips, follow with the shoulder and plan on releasing the disc as it reaches the plane of your body. You should be able to get a good wrist snap to add some distance as well.\nFlick hucks are similar to backhands in that power should come primarily from your core. Lead with the hips and shoulders, then let your wrist do the rest.\nFor both forehand and backhands, power should be generated primarily by the torso. Open-side hucking is easy on the flick side because it releases very quickly, but on the backhand side, a good marker will be able to pressure the slower throw and infringe on your follow through space.\nPulling is a essentially an exagerated backhand huck where you get to run up. First, establish a footwork routine that you will follow for all of your pulls. For me, I take three steps and release. If pulling upwind, try to ride any semblance of angle the wind gives you. The field is 40 yards wide. From one corner you should be able to throw further if you ride some of the crosswind. In severe wind incorporating a 360° spin at your release can add some distance, which is handy during hurricane season. A good pull is primarily about keeping it in play. OB pulls are no good. Secondarily, finding the right balance between distance and height is key. Hangtime allows the defense to set up while distance without good hangtime is less useful. It\u0026rsquo;s better to throw 65 yard pulls that are well covered than 85 yard pulls that are line drives.\nI think the best way to expand your range is to throw a lot. Because you can\u0026rsquo;t necessarily do so in game situations, throwing casually can help. Just make sure to be bettering your form at all times. If you relax your form, then any work you put in will be pointless. Work on throwing hucks as if there were a mark, even if you\u0026rsquo;re throwing on the open side. As a general rule, I\u0026rsquo;d say if you can\u0026rsquo;t throw a flat huck, then don\u0026rsquo;t throw one so work on long flat throws.\n"

On a long backhand the first point is to step out so that when you twist your body you\u0026rsquo;re not killing your defender with a giant elbow to the face (this is easier for tall players—shorter players should focus on a quick stepout). While stepping out, I also reach the disc out as far as I can to create the longest lever possible (thus creating the most force). The last major step is to rip it—use your abs to pull your arm across and really focus on opening your body all the way toward where you are throwing. Your left arm should be relaxed and end up above your right foot while your entire right arm should rip through to be above your left foot (obviously switch for lefties).\nBased on this, if you were going to pick something to train for distance throwing, I\u0026rsquo;d work on my core muscles. Also, you can always grip it harder to get more spin, particularly for keeping these long throws in inclement weather.\n"

  "author": "Nancy Sun",
  "issue": "010",
  "content": "When I think about throwing long, it helps me to visualize a spring in action. I try to activate four parts of my body that act as springs: legs, hips, shoulders, elbow, and wrist. As I wind up for the throw, I think about compressing these springs in turn and as I throw, I think about releasing each of the springs. The legs are an important part of the step; I step out as far as I can to still feel completely balanced throughout the throw. Step evenly with your legs, rotate your torso through your legs and hips, drive your shoulder, lead your wrist with your elbow, and finally snap your wrist. This works for both the forehand and backhand.\nWhen I am shooting for maximum distance, I try to throw the disc so it has three stages of flight (credit for the \u0026ldquo;three stages of flight\u0026rdquo; terminology to Tiina Booth and NUTC):\n1. Disc starts with some inside-out (more i/o with more headwind),\n2. Flattens out, and then,\n3. Finishes its flight path by spinning in (still mostly flat) towards your receiver.\nA few details related to each throw:\nForehand. I think the most important thing to keep in mind when throwing a long forehand is to focus on throwing hard, not far. Thinking about this focuses me on keeping my form compact and makes me think about snapping the disc quickly and hard.\nWhen you watch a baseball pitcher, there is a moment in time where they have not yet released the pitch, but their arm is moving forwards and you see their elbow leading their wrist through the throwing motion. (A quick Google Image Search brings this.) This same leading with the elbow motion is what I think about when I am about to release a disc because it helps me get all the possible snap out of my wrist.\nA few ways to practice wrist snap for the forehand: Throw fast and flat (not high arcing) blades with a partner. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have a partner, often indoor tracks or gyms have these tall, heavy curtains that you can pull out and throw blades upwards on. Also fun to try to catch the rebound.\nBackhand. Visualize yourself inside a hula hoop that is suspended in the air about chest height. As you bend at the waist, the angle of the hula hoop changes with respect to the ground, but stays the same with respect to your upper body. You can vary the angle of inside-out on the throw by bending at the waist. When executing my throwing motion, I try to think about keeping the disc in the plane of the hula hoop. Air resistance (including wind) will make the disc flatten out.\nTwo things especially useful for pulling are to think about bringing the disc behind you as far as you can during your windup and on curling it into your wrist.\nAs with the forehand, focus on throwing hard, not far.\n"

  "title": "My Secrets For Throwing Farther",
  "author": "Parker Krug",
  "issue": "010",
  "content": "How to throw farther.\nA good question. To start I will say this. Some people do not have the physical ability to throw as far as others. Strength, body type, and other factors are the reason behind this. However, there are ways to throw further no matter how far you can throw it now.\nTECHNIQUES\nThe best throwers in the game and their ability to throw the disc further than others is based on a few techniques.\nIn my opinion the most important of these techniques is the grip. A loose grip with result in a weak release with little spin. Which is okay for shorter throws with touch. A strong grip, strong enough that the disc can not be moved from their fingers while the disc is being held, is key in getting distance on your throws. Gripping the disc firmly will not only allow you to produce more spin on the release but will also allow you to hold onto the disc as you throw it with all your strength. A weak grip and a strong throw will result in an early and most likely inaccurate release. A good strong grip is key when throwing for distance.\nWatch people as the try to throw far in practice and you will usually see them step forward in an attempt to get the disc out in front of them as soon as possible, this is a mistake. By stepping forward you will limit how much spin you can put on the disc, and spin is what helps the disc cut through the air. Spin is a result of the snap of our wrists as we release the disc, and is another key component in throwing far. It is much harder to get that snap as you step forward, and that\u0026rsquo;s because the angle of your wrist is not conducive to a strong snap in front of your body. So while practicing, continue to step to the side when releasing a huck. This will also help you feel more comfortable while throwing a huck with a mark on you.\nWhen throwing a disc for distance you must consider the effects the air/wind will have on it. To achieve your maximum distance in a windy situation, I believe an inside-out throw is best. A disc that starts its I/O angle will lose less spin and speed early in its flight than an outside-in angle will. It will then flatten out and float as far as the spin and strength behind it will allow it to. This is especially true when the wind is strong. An extreme inside-out angle is the only way to get distance in an extreme wind. Outside- in throws will achieve the distance of an inside-out throw only if going down wind. I leave it up to you to choose which angle works best for you going down wind.\nPRACTICE\nPersonally when I practice hucking I try to simulate game time situations. That means, even though there is no mark, I am still stepping out and in my mind breaking the mark to release my huck. I also throw one or two fakes in before I huck, as most marks will stop your first and maybe even your second choice. However, I have learned through my experience that if the mark stops your first huck look and especially your second, it is better to holster that throw and move the disc elsewhere.\nThe most accurate and best choice huck tends to be one without a mark. How do you get a huck without a mark, you ask? Give-and-go. Getting the disc on the move, hopefully up field, will give you an open look at your target without a mark. However, it is not easy to stop running, establish a pivot foot, and step to the side to throw a good huck. So while practicing hucks, throw the disc a few yards in front of yourself, run up to it and catch it and throw it. Remember to step out to the side and not forward, especially in this situation. This will simulate a game time give-and-go into a huck. Personally, that is my favorite huck look.\nEXERCISES\nThere are a few muscles key to the success of throwing the disc far. First is your hand/fingers and wrist strength. These muscles allow us to \u0026ldquo;grip it and rip it,\u0026rdquo; if you will. Wrist curls, strength balls for your hands, and that gyro-ball that spins while you rotate your wrist are all exercises I do to increase and maintain my hand and wrist strength. This is especially true with the flick/forehand. It is called a flick for a reason, there is little to no body in the throw. It\u0026rsquo;s all in the \u0026ldquo;flick\u0026rdquo; of your wrist. Backhands tend to go a bit further because you can get your body into it. A strong core, upper back, arms and shoulders will all help increase your backhand distance. Curls, chops, sit-ups, military press, push-ups, and planks are just a few I do to maintain that strength. There are plenty of exercises that will give the same result.\nMY SECRETS\nIf there is one thing I would tell someone looking to throw the disc far, it\u0026rsquo;s this: get out there and play some disc golf (with Ultimate discs). But don\u0026rsquo;t simulate a pull every time you are on the tee-box, like most do. Establish a pivot foot, throw a fake, and then huck your disc towards the target. My throws are not as far as the other guys as they run up to the line and throw theirs. That\u0026rsquo;s fine. My approach shots always make up for that. Come tournament time, however, this technique pays off. I have no problem stepping out and throwing a disc as hard and/or far as I can without traveling, because I have done it hundreds of times more than most.\n"

  "issue": "010",
  "content": "Hailing from Paideia I probably started throwing a frisbee earlier than most. In 4th grade I was learning push passes, thumbers, and scoobers from Coach Baccarini in addition to the more conventional flicks, backhands, and hammers. As soon as I picked up a disc I wanted to know how I could throw farther, faster, and better. But it wasn\u0026rsquo;t until my senior year in high school that I was able to figure out how to throw deep with consistency from both the backhand and forehand side. Part of the delayed development was certainly attributable to regaining coordination after growth spurts, but a large part of figuring out how to throw deep was studying the mechanics of great long throwers and understanding what characteristics of their mechanics I could employ.\nMy career at the high school, college, and club levels has been built on my ability to stretch the defense by throwing it really far. Over the last ten years I\u0026rsquo;ve learned while every person and body type throws deep differently there are mechanical fundamentals that can help everyone improve their hucking.\n1. Grip\nTo be a good thrower at any distance you must hold the disc in such a way that you are able to throw smoothly and comfortably without any wobbles upon release. This becomes especially important when throwing deep because a clean release can be be the difference between a nice pass out to space and a swill hospital pass that sails out of bounds. A key to the grip when throwing deep is holding the disc tighter so that your release is more snappy. Find your own comfortable and tight grip for your flick and your backhand and then practice it. Practice switching from one grip to the other, pivoting, and faking. If you always have a disc in your hands your new long-bomb tight grip will become second nature.\n2. Wrist\nFor Happy Gilmore it was all in the hips, but for throwing it\u0026rsquo;s all in the wrist. The harder and faster you can snap your wrist while throwing, the faster and farther you will be able to throw. To work your flick wrist snap try throwing 5 yard blades with a partner without moving anything except your wrist. Attempt to get as many revolutions on the disc within those 5 yards as possible. To work on your backhand wrist snap you can use a similar drill and throw five yard backhands only using your wrist or you can take a deck of cards and whip them Gambit style one by one at a corner in your room. It sounds silly, but if you don\u0026rsquo;t have a clean and tight wrist snapping motion the cards are going to flutter around the room instead of zoom into the corner like they should.\n3. Arm\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve mastered the grip and wrist the next level of throwing is working on your arm mechanics and follow through. If you can generate some serious arm speed you are going to be able to launch the frisbee a long way. Some of the greatest huckers in the game can throw 60 or more yards using no body movement because the speed they generate with their arm, the power of their wrist snap, and the smoothness of their grip work harmoniously and efficiently. Practice isolating your arm motion by throwing from your knees with a partner 20 yards away. It will feel strange at first, but once it gets more comfortable start throwing faster and faster while making sure that your release is always clean and throws are never wobbly. Push ups, pull ups, dips, and military presses are also exercises that will help your arms get stronger and more capable of creating the desired velocity on your throws.\n4. Body\nThis last mechanical fundamental in deep throwing is the most complicated. It is also the one for which there is the greatest diversity amongst even the best bombers. Some players rock from their heels to a forward step when they throw deep while others pivot extremely wide. Still there are others who step backwards to generatetheir throwing momentum while a few may not pivot at all. Each of these styles, from both the backhand and flick side, deserve exploration until you find the one that fits you and your body type the best. All things being equal pivoting wide to the side is the best because it gets you far away from the mark. The general truths for using your body when hucking are that you need to find a stance that will enable to have your balance at all times, but will also help you to create an absurd amount of torque. Try throwing disc golf discs as far as you can to work on your backhand body mechanics. The smaller, heavier discs cause you to exaggerate your windup and can help workout kinks. If nothing else they can boost the ego since they will fly much farther than normal frisbees. For the flick side I have no cool exercise suggestions but keep in mind that your forehand can go much farther if you get your core involved productively. To that end, any core strengthening exercises that you do will help your overall athleticism as well as your hucking.\n"

In this issue, we'll discuss the thought processes that go into making these decisions.\nIn this issue of The Huddle we have asked our roster of authors to dish out advice about strategies for line calling. We gave them a hypothetical: your team's regular sub-caller is becoming curiously mute just before Regionals, and must pass on what she knows about sub-calling to a teammate before she loses her voice completely.\nAre there tried-and-true formulas, schemes, and patterns for superior sub-calling?

  "content": "Sub-calling is probably the least rewarding aspect of Ultimate. Not only will you rarely be recognized for good sub-calling, but instead sub-calling is the easiest thing for many people to blame for problems on the field. Additionally, problems (real or perceived) with playing time and sub-calling are often the number one issue affecting team dynamics and player satisfaction. In my experience, the easiest way to avoid issues with subcalling is to have a plan ahead of time and to communicate as best as possible to individuals where their role fits into that plan. A good plan can then be passed along to someone else who needs to fill in for sub-calling in a pinch (like losing your voice in a freak scenario). Here\u0026rsquo;s a basic checklist of questions you can answer when devising your plan:\nWhich handlers do you want playing primarily offensive points and which do you want playing defensive points? Who do you want to be able to go both ways?\nWhich downfield cutters offer a competitive advantage on O lines or D lines?\nWhich defenders primarily guard handlers? Which are especially good at covering downfielders?\nWho fills special niche defensive roles on the team? For example, an especially tall defender to neutralize the deep threat or an especially good marker to put on a big thrower.\nDivide your handlers up into groups of those who generate offense with their throws (big breaks and/or big hucks) and those who generate offense with their legs (effectively get the disc up-the-line and are always open for resets). You\u0026rsquo;ll want some players from each category on every line.\nDivide your downfielders into groups of those who can get open with jukes off of a stopped-disc and those who are great at getting open in flow with timing and filling spaces. Again, you\u0026rsquo;ll want some players from each category on every line.\nAre there players who have especially good chemistry on the team together?\nWho are on your special teams? Who are your top zone D players, zone O players, clam defenders, and so on.\nWho are your clutch players? Who do you put in for critical points that are must-score situations on O and/or on D?\nWhat are the situations that your bottom of the roster performs best in? Being able to utilize your bench players effectively is often the difference between winning and losing in the long run.\nObviously, there are a number of different questions you can ask yourself about your team and its players. The important part is that you are creating an accurate assessment of your players and how they fit together in various different situations, so you can create a subbing structure around that and communicate it to the team. Subbing structures don\u0026rsquo;t need to be super sophisticated, but having guidelines on how to choose players for each line will greatly speed up the process for your subcallers, enable them to call better lines under time pressure, and allow players to better expect when they are likely to go in or remain on the sideline.\n"

We beat Boston four times that season: Regionals, Tune-up, and two small pre- season tourneys. And that season we lost two games, both at Nationals: Sockeye in pool play, and Boston in the semi-finals.\n\u0026ldquo;If you don\u0026rsquo;t step up your game, quit calling yourself in!\u0026rdquo;\nThis said with spittle flying everywhere; and that comment is watered down compared to others heard and learned of later, not to mention the immediate silence encountered after hobbling down the hall and popping into room 237.\nAs a spectator in 2002, I hustled over to see the end of the Furious/Boston semi after Ring defeated Sockeye in the other semifinal. I found myself standing behind a handful of Sockeye players seated along the sideline. They were not quite digesting the big let down and were busy chewing on the bitter pill, calling out the late-game leadership and decision making, dragging everyone under the bus. All of the trust building drills throughout the course of the season seemed to be a pitiful waste. Though rotation wasn\u0026rsquo;t the issue, part of me was them. Weeks before I watched, somewhat helplessly, a 14-10 lead on Ring and a sure ticket to Nationals slip away as Ring rolled off five for the win and a spot in the Regional final. The old Gas House Gorillas routine was certainly overlooked that day.\nA place in the sun isn\u0026rsquo;t meant for everyone (and Sockeye\u0026rsquo;s casting a long shadow), and when the chips fall the other way, a thankless job is, indeed, thankless.\nBe careful what you wish for.\n"

Rats.\nTo avoid this situation you must speak with the uttermost clarity and amplification. You mustn\u0026rsquo;t slur your speech; too often names like Sean and John or Brett and Bren become confused. You mustn\u0026rsquo;t misspeak—say who you mean and mean whom you say. And finally, you mustn\u0026rsquo;t forget the names of your players. Nothing is worse than failing to recall (or actually not knowing) a player on your team. Review the roster list before the tournament. Believe me, this can be embarrassing.\nBeyond basic slips of the tongue, you must be wary of under- or over-counting. Thou shalt count to seven. No more, no less. Seven shall be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be seven. Eight shalt thou not count; neither count thou six, excepting that thou then proceed to seven. Nine is right out.

You\u0026rsquo;ve graduated, you\u0026rsquo;re washed up, and no one wants to see your slow, no-defense-playing, sorry ass on the field.

  "content": "I\u0026rsquo;ve been very fortunate in my career to play on many successful teams that did not call subs, and this hypothetical situation could be a blessing in disguise. Most players at elite levels are fairly self-aware, and after a season of playing together most can recognize the hierarchy within the team and could make an honest appraisal of their optimum contribution to the team in terms of quantity and type (O or D) of points.\nSome players may have to be told more explicitly ahead of time (and reminded during a game) but most will have a good idea. At its best, allowing players to put themselves in the game empowers them to control their contribution, to put themselves in when they are feeling ready, and gives the rest of the team confidence in them.\nThis may not work for every team, but I have been a part of very successful groups where self-subbing was an ingrained part of the team structure, took the onus of subbing off one person and distributed it to everyone, and created an environment of success which pushed each player in practice and games to achieve their best on the field.\n"

  "content": "Sub-calling, especially for one who one who plays at the same time, is one of the most difficult things to do. Personally, I hate doing it because I feel like it distracts me from my ability to remain focused while playing. But like everyone, I always have my own feelings about who should be playing at a particular time. Fortunately, as captain of my team, my opinion about who plays carries a bit of weight with the sub-caller. What I\u0026rsquo;ve learned is that the ideal sub-callers understand that they have a duty to the team rather than to their teammates, demonstrate objectivity and detachedness in performing that duty, and have an ability to quickly evaluate changing conditions.\nOf course when playing time is not distributed equally, there will always be someone who is disappointed with the sub-caller\u0026rsquo;s decisions. Dealing with these types of complaints can be uncomfortable because they require explaining to a friend why you chose to play someone else instead of him or her. I think there are four things that the sub-caller has to do in these situations:\n1. Delay the discussion until after the game. Because of everything that a sub-caller needs to concentrate on during the game, complaints simply cannot be dealt with until after the game because dealing with complaints would disrupt effective sub calling.\n2. Listen to the player. Understand exactly what the complaint is. (Does he believe he is not playing enough? Believe certain types of players are not playing enough? Believe he is not playing enough at certain times (ie: zone)). Listening is extremely important because you can tailor you answer to his concerns. Also, sometimes part of the solution is for the player to know his concerns have been taken seriously.\n3. Honestly explain the decision to keep that player off the field (you haven\u0026rsquo;t mastered this offense/defense in practice, you are not in condition, you were limping that last point and wanted to give you some time to recover, you displayed a string of bad decisions, the guy who played instead of you was on fire/had a great match up).\n4. Identify what that player can work on to fix it. This communication is very important because it gives the player a clear idea of what he has to focus on to get better. When he gets better the team gets better.\n"

  "content": "1. If you pick the right personnel, there will always be a time when you can play each player. Think about when these times are for each player on your team and allow them to excel in these situations.\n2. Be clear to your teammates about the team\u0026rsquo;s sub-calling philosophy. If it changes for a tournament, don\u0026rsquo;t make it a hush hush operation—let everyone know so nothing is a surprise.\n3. When at all possible, have someone who\u0026rsquo;s not playing (a coach or designated sub-caller, perhaps even an injured player) call subs. Sub-calling and playing time create the most opportunities for team chemistry to breakdown and when your playing time, which directly relates to most people\u0026rsquo;s enjoyment of their playing, is dictated by peers, it can get ugly, fast.\n4. Sub to win. At the elite level, everyone would rather be on a winning team and play one point per game than be on a losing team and play five points per game. Or at least we should—if people aren\u0026rsquo;t on board with this—reconsider their options, which is fine.\n5. Don\u0026rsquo;t get caught up in specialization. I think this may apply even more to Women\u0026rsquo;s Ultimate than Open Ultimate, but if you have a good player on your team, don\u0026rsquo;t keep her in the \u0026ldquo;D line\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;O line\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Zone\u0026rdquo; or whatever you think she is best at if she might be able to help the team in lots of different situations. The reality is that there will always be turnovers, teams will always throw different D and O looks, so just play your strong players that get the job done in all situations and be creative with their supporting cast.\n"

  "issue": "009",
  "content": "When I was calling subs, I also usually was calling the \u0026ldquo;strategy\u0026rdquo; for the points. (Are we playing zone? Are we setting horizontal? Is this point the most critical point ever?). That helped me when it came to determining players based on the roles needed. It also made me pretty tired by the end of the day. How these decisions are made on your team will help dictate who should call subs when the sub-caller goes down with a freak throat injury (Larynxeum andibenitis). For example, if there are two people who call the O and two people who call the D, can one of them handle the sub-calling as well? That will simplify the discussions, and it will help with establishing authority for the sub-caller. If this is not as strict (is it just a leader on the field who does it?), then I would suggest establishing a short discussion prior to each point to set that down. That discussion should be 5 seconds or less.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a suggested transcript:\nSub-Caller: What\u0026rsquo;s the D?\nStrategy Person: Clam for five to backhand.\nSub-Caller: Ok, (seven names) you\u0026rsquo;re in.\nIt is within the idea of strategy that some of the subtleties that I believe are the hardest to convey to a new sub-caller appear. A few examples:\n- It\u0026rsquo;s double game point and we\u0026rsquo;re receiving. Perhaps one of my top handlers is also one of my higher risk handlers (bigger throws, less prone to possession) or maybe one of my top handlers has a habit of tightening up on the big points. Do I need that person on the field or is it too high a risk at that point in the game?\n- The other team is kicking our butts by sending out three tall receivers, but it\u0026rsquo;s the mark getting broken that is setting up the throws. Do I need my best markers or tallest players (or both)?\nGiven the parameters of the question, I bring out a pad of paper and a pen for stuff like this. The strategy leadership needs to pass this information to the sub-caller. This needs to be communicated during the game, and the number of people who are allowed to talk to the sub-caller about this has to be limited for a new one. That needs to be established prior to the weekend with the entire team.\nSub-calling starts early in the season and lasts throughout the year. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t just mean the act of calling out names between points, but rather consists of preparing people for the role that they will play, ensuring that they know that role and clearly communicating expectations throughout the year. If the fourth person down the depth chart of O handlers who has never played a D point actually expects to go in when you\u0026rsquo;re pulling at 14-14 in the semis of regionals, that\u0026rsquo;s a personal problem. Sub-callers and captains need to ignore that at all points at Regionals. It\u0026rsquo;s more likely that someone who is down the depth chart a bit starts to think that they should be playing more at the end of games. This is still a personal problem, not a team one. It only becomes a team problem if it distracts leadership from their roles. If I\u0026rsquo;m training a new sub-caller, I tell them that during the game is not the time for this, and they just need to send that person to me or to a different captain at that point. The sub-caller can\u0026rsquo;t spend time on it. No need to yell at this person, but the sub-caller needs to simply-and-firmly tell the person to go away until after the game. Then, I\u0026rsquo;d suggest that the person only talk to the captain, and the captain talks to the sub-caller (assuming they are different people). That message also needs to go to the entire team before the weekend. Captain to team: \u0026ldquo;Billy-Jean will be calling subs this weekend. Do not insert yourself into this process. If you have a problem with this, talk to me. If Billy-Jean asks you to do something, play or sub out, do it.\u0026rdquo;\nMost teams have defined positions or roles (O/D, handler/upfield, more points/less points, zone breakers, upwind players), and the general theory of the team has likely been discussed prior to the week of Regionals (fortunately). The sub-caller should understand these key principles and who fits into what roles. A hierarchy can be important to understand as well. Some teams seemed to have a group of individuals who can self-sub (Did it look like DoG was calling subs on offense when they were winning? Or did 7 people just kind of wander out on to the field and then score?). The sub-caller absolutely has to know who can and cannot do that and has to have the confidence and strength of personality to stop those who can\u0026rsquo;t do it and sometimes stop those who can do it.\nWhen I called subs for teams, I kept a sheet of who had played how many points. I changed organization of the sheet depending on the team, but:\n- For teams which were almost exclusively O/D, I would split the list that way. This presented some challenge for the few players who did play both, but it was helpful. Then, within the groups I split handlers and upfield cutters.\n- For teams which were not as heavily O/D, I split handlers and upfield. This is what I did almost always. I expected some variance, but usually wind, the type of O or D, the situation dictated which of those groups I needed more than anything else.\nI would refer to the sheet occasionally through the game, but not necessarily on every line call. I also had others helping keep the sheet filled out so that I could pay attention to how the game was going. I asked those people to tell me things like: if a key player has played four or more points in a row early in a game, if a player we\u0026rsquo;d need at the end of the game hadn\u0026rsquo;t played in six or more points, and so on. Just those things are enough to help guide what needs to be done. When I coached, I did the same thing. In addition to the points-sheet, it\u0026rsquo;s useful for a new sub-caller to have a sheet which has the roles and hierarchy. For example, that sheet might have four sections: Vertical O, Horizontal O, Person D, Zone D. That\u0026rsquo;s the playbook. Laminate it and tape it to the sub-callers arm. Within each section, it would list in order of hierarchy, handlers then upfielders. That\u0026rsquo;s the sheet that person would use most often. I didn\u0026rsquo;t actually carry this, as I felt that I knew it by the time it mattered, but if someone is doing it for the first time at Regionals, it will help.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t keep turnovers, O/D or other information on the points sheet, because that was simply more information than I could process while making decisions. If others put the information on the sheet, I thanked them nicely and then ignored it. It\u0026rsquo;s good information to have when evaluating how things went, but just too much for the heat-of-the-moment. Some people may be able to process all of that information, but I kinda doubt it. My feeling was that, unless a key player was having the type of hellish game that was obvious to everyone, that person didn\u0026rsquo;t sit more when it mattered. Play time is usually earned over a season, not in the 1 vs. 16 game at Regionals. Likewise, if a player down the depth chart had earned more points, it\u0026rsquo;s obvious.\nOne special situation: Let\u0026rsquo;s say my team is pretty much O and D split. Let\u0026rsquo;s say the O isn\u0026rsquo;t getting it done. We had a three point lead. The handlers seem spent and we\u0026rsquo;ve turned it over two in a row, and it\u0026rsquo;s now tight. My D line has 2 of my best handlers on it. Do I put the two D guys in with the rest of the O line? Do I put seven from in the D line to play O? To oversimplify the answer: If I practice almost entirely split between the lines or if my D plays O differently than my O, I put in the D line. Otherwise, I put in the D handlers with the O line.\nSpecial Mixed Note: I\u0026rsquo;ve seen a number of teams that have a woman sub-caller and a male sub-caller. Those two tend to work together on some teams and independently on other teams. I think it\u0026rsquo;s natural that the players are aware a bit more of their gender on the field. It\u0026rsquo;s important that the \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; sub- caller get with the other sub-caller in this situation and understand when to and when not to worry about what the other one is doing. Both are still subservient to the strategy role, but they need to know how the roles work together.\nAnd a final point about picking a sub-caller: some people with all the skills (confidence, authority, perception, know the players, see the game) can\u0026rsquo;t manage to call subs and play at their top level. Some can, but some just can\u0026rsquo;t. If someone struggles to focus on their own game when they are calling subs, that person can really only be the sub-caller if they don\u0026rsquo;t have to play at all. Perhaps the editors can twist an ankle on that person and make this assignment easy? (Editor\u0026rsquo;s Note: No.)\n"

  "content": "First things first—calling subs for a competitive team is a big job. It will take a lot away from anyone\u0026rsquo;s playing ability. There may be someone out there who can play at their best and call subs at the same time, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t met them. Because of this, I think it\u0026rsquo;s better to split sub-calling duties between two or three players, or expect that the person calling subs is not going to play very much.\nTo me, the most important element of sub-calling is being prepared. You should know pretty well before the tournament starts who\u0026rsquo;s going to play, how much, and in what situations. You need to leave room for adjustment based on how each person is playing at the moment, but having an idea beforehand is a huge help.\nSub-calling sheets are great. A simple grid works well, with the players listed on the side, and points across the top. You can easily see how many points each person\u0026rsquo;s played, how long they\u0026rsquo;ve been in or out. Grouping handlers, cutters, defenders together also helps. It\u0026rsquo;s pretty easy to add basic stats to such a grid, and to get your next line ready during the point. In a game with strict time limits, you should ideally have an O line and a D line ready before the point ends. If you need to change one or two people, that\u0026rsquo;s much easier than picking a full seven.\nWhen it comes to picking players for each line, subbing should be strategic, over the course of the game and the tournament. If your defense is forcing lots of turnovers but having trouble scoring, you can bring over a more offensive-minded player. In general, you want your best players to be in when you need them, but rested enough that they\u0026rsquo;re still going strong in finals or that last backdoor game of Regionals. This strategy will vary depending on your team\u0026rsquo;s composition, but here\u0026rsquo;s one example of what I mean.\nFor many of its years at the top of the Open ultimate scene, Furious George has been a top-heavy team. Their best five or six players were better than anyone else\u0026rsquo;s, and they knew it. But they couldn\u0026rsquo;t play those guys every point, so most of the time they\u0026rsquo;d mix them in with role players (who were, granted, also very good). A couple times a game, they\u0026rsquo;d put most or all of their strongest players in for one defensive point, with the intention of getting a break on that one point. It usually worked. Against the consistent offenses in the elite game, defensive breaks are enormously important. One break can be the difference between a win and a loss, and a huge momentum swing. By targeting particular points for breaks, Furious George was able to maintain a high level of play throughout games and tournaments, but bring it up one big step when it counted the most.\n"

  "content": "It is a big point midway through a big game at the most important high school elite open tourney of the year. The opposing team has taken a timeout between points. You look at the team you coach to figure out what line you want in the game. You know that a number of your kids haven\u0026rsquo;t been in the game yet and that they paid a lot of money to make the plane trip. Oh, and there are those same kids\u0026rsquo; parents who also came along and have been making runs to the store all weekend to make sure the team has everything that they need. You\u0026rsquo;ve been coaching some of those kids since middle school and you\u0026rsquo;ve known the parents for years because you coached their other child. Some of those great kids who haven\u0026rsquo;t played yet are seniors who played on JV for three years and have been waiting for the chance to make the difference in helping the varsity win a championship. Because you work with your feeder programs as well, you notice that some of those other kids who haven\u0026rsquo;t played are a couple of the freshmen who were the stronger players on the 8th grade team last year. Those freshmen love to compete and are going to be a big part of the team somewhere down the road. They are dying to get into the game to show they can make plays at important times in high school games. Everybody is looking at you with hopeful eyes of helping the team succeed. What do you do?\nThere are a lot of pressures on coaches. Calling subs is one of those pressures. It is true in every team sport. Determining who actually gets to play can be very distasteful. It probably ranks third in the down sides of coaching behind a player getting seriously injured and having to cut people from the team. The question is: \u0026ldquo;How do you deal with subbing to help the team succeed?\u0026rdquo; Subbing is not a decision that is made in a vacuum of just this particular point. There is always the bigger picture of keeping morale high, keeping people invested in the program, keeping parents happy, and keeping the administrators off your back. And the truly odd thing is that winning does not cure all ills in a program. You can win championships and still be hammered on your evaluations because winning isn\u0026rsquo;t everything even when losing is unacceptable.\nBack to the game. What do you do? Simple. You tell your power line and power rotation that they are in the game and that they are not coming out until the game is over or the other team obviously gives up. Are the players who haven\u0026rsquo;t gone in yet mad because they may not get to play in this game? How mad are the parents who came to watch their kid play and their kid probably won\u0026rsquo;t go in the game? The answer is that people might be a little disappointed which is natural and even desirable (you certainly don\u0026rsquo;t want too many kids on the team who want to sit out the big points), but the bottom line is that every player on the team knows his role, as do the parents, because you have properly prepared them for this moment.\nAt the beginning of the season the coach needs to communicate with everyone about the expectations of being on the varsity team and what it means. Experienced coaches know the importance of putting it in writing, announcing it at the team parent meeting, and repeating it often at practices and games. Also, before and after every game you start your speech by pointing out how important the players who are not getting or did not get in the game are to the success of the team. You don\u0026rsquo;t say this to be nice, you say it because it is true. It is both a cliché and very overlooked that being a team player is of huge value. Your chances of succeeding are vastly increased if the players who don\u0026rsquo;t get much, if any, playing time, are as excited or more excited than the players on the field when the team has success. Those role players have very important roles in practices and games that are often overlooked by those people only watching the games. One of the great things about ultimate is that players on the sidelines can actually help the team succeed by communicating important info to the players on the field.\nBack to the game. Is the power line ready to go in? Do the players in the power rotation who are not in know that they are in the tighter rotation of people playing these next all important points? Of course they do. You have practiced and played with this rotation already in both practices and games. Plus you have it written down on your subbing rotation sheet.\nSo why rotations and not calling lines? There is the issue of players knowing what to expect in situations so they can be prepared mentally. There is the issue of a coach trying to call lines and make strategy adjustments at the same time that just leads to the wrong players on the field and not so great adjustments. And yes, coaches want to control the subs and the adjustments. (There are two kinds of coaches when it comes to control. Those who are obviously control freaks and those who are good at hiding that they are control freaks). So, how do you get the right players on the field at the right time while still being able to make strategy adjustments on the fly? Well it obviously helps to have good assistant coaches who know what the plan is, can take charge AND do not get flustered when the head coach overrules them with an adjustment. But more importantly you have set up your rotations beforehand.\nIt can be as simple as ranking your players as ones, twos, or threes, with ones being your strongest players. Usually you will have equal numbers of ones and twos with only a couple of threes. You add an \u0026ldquo;H\u0026rdquo; for the handlers. You then sort by rank. (I prefer a spreadsheet.) You communicate with everyone about their rank and you practice with different rotations. The rank includes both offensive and defensive talent. In HS elite ultimate you can generally figure out how to make sure your least able defensive player on the field doesn\u0026rsquo;t mark up against the other teams\u0026rsquo; strongest offensive players. And every kid on the team knows how to throw resets and easy scores (and to know the difference between an easy score finish and a not-so-easy score finish) if they get the disc on offense and are not a primary handler.\nDifferent kinds of rotations (Ones will rotate in for ones, twos for twos, and threes for threes, in all rotations):\nStandard Rotation: 1h, 1h, 1, 1, 2h, 2, 3 Even Rotation: 1h, 1h, 1, 2h, 2, 3, 3. (This can also be 1h, 1, 2h, 2h, 2, 3, 3) Power Rotation: 1h, 1h, 1h, 1, 1, 1, 1 (Don\u0026rsquo;t save the power rotation for late in games. Use it to get an early lead, to get the important breaks, to end a big game as quick as possible in tournament play) 2/3 Rotation: 2h, 2h, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3. (This group has practiced against the power rotation so they are comfortable playing together. If the power rotation has just run off four or five points against an opponent, put this rotation in and tell them they stay in until they give up a score.) Fun rotations: Tall, Short, Seniors, 9/10, Soccer, Basketball. If all goes well and you picked the correct rotations and made the proper strategy adjustments you have put your team into a position where they have found success on the field. It is not quite over yet, you still have to make a good post game speech where you will mention the role players first and stress how important they were to the success of the team. And when one of the parents who has been working hard for your program and whose kid didn\u0026rsquo;t play in the big game comes up to you and says, \u0026ldquo;Hey coach, I asked my son how he felt about not playing in that game and he explained to me that he was okay with it because he knew his role and feels that he helped the team succeed as much as the guys who were in the game. Nice job coach. I\u0026rsquo;ll see you this summer. My son is really looking forward to improving his skill set.\u0026rdquo; Well, you know that you will probably get to keep your job for another year. You get three days before the high of winning the tournament wears off. Four days from now you get to start thinking about next year by looking at the rotation sheets to see how many points each kid played and what needs to be done for next year.\n"

  "content": "Here are a couple little tricks that can really help you out.\nThis first technique is something I\u0026rsquo;ve never done, but I\u0026rsquo;m still gonna name it. Let\u0026rsquo;s call it Repeater. I saw it first at College Nationals this year, where Syzygy was using it (they crushed us) and I later overheard teams using it at Solstice (Eugene) and HoDown (Calgary). Basically, your sub caller yells out the names just as usual and then everyone repeats them. \u0026ldquo;Beth.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;BETH!\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Kate.\u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;KATE!\u0026rdquo; And so forth. It\u0026rsquo;s really a wonderful piece of technology. It focuses your team on the point ahead and helps avoid that dratted looking-for- someone-on-the-sideline-and-yelling-their-name business. This technique does require that your sub caller have a decision very quickly, but you can always make on the line changes after the seven are out there.\nThis second technique is one that I\u0026rsquo;ve used twice and each time it was incredibly effective. You almost always (particularly in women\u0026rsquo;s) have a player with a season ending injury. Have them call subs. I had a sophomore (Jinny Eun of Riot) do this for Syzygy the year we won. Did she know what she was doing at the beginning of the season? Absolutely not. Did she know what she was doing at the end of the season? Definitely. It takes a lot of work on the part of a coach or a captain to teach someone to call subs, but it is absolutely worth it. Obviously, this person doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be a rookie. This past year for Oregon, one of our captains (Gordy) blew her knee out and immediately took over from me as main sub caller. As a coach or captain, you are freed from the tyranny of the clipboard. Free to actually coach or play. Then, subbing becomes one more area of oversight, like play-calling or defense or analyzing the other team\u0026rsquo;s best player.\nRemember, the best sub caller is Victory and the worst sub caller is Defeat.\n"

  "content": "Sub-calling is one of the most difficult parts of being a team leader, be it as a coach or a player. As coach of Kali (the University of Colorado Women\u0026rsquo;s team), I have employed several different strategies throughout the years depending on the team. In this article, I\u0026rsquo;ll try to give young players some insight into one coach\u0026rsquo;s perspective of sub-calling.\nMy sub-calling strategy begins in the organization of my sub sheet. I split players into pods, generally four or five.\nPod 1—Veteran Handlers: As a coach, I realize that our chances of scoring increase significantly if there are at least two confident throwers on the line.\nPod 2—Veteran Cutters \u0026amp; Defenders: These are my athletes who I trust in their knowledge of the game and defensive ability but may not be as comfortable with the disc.\nPod 3—Young Handlers: These are the next generation handlers who may not have all the skills or confidence yet to touch the disc all the time, but are likely to develop into good handlers given enough touches.\nPod 4—Young Cutters \u0026amp; Athletes: These are my first or second year players who seem to \u0026ldquo;get it\u0026rdquo; and have an idea of where to go on the field and when to go there, but aren\u0026rsquo;t consistent yet with their skills.\nPod 5—Rawest rookies: This pod contains the players who are very new to the sport and may tend to get a little lost or confused on the field at times due to the game being so new.\nMy use of the pods changes based on the opponent. In games against inferior opponents where the score is unlikely to be close, I tend to sub liberally and pull 3-4 players per line from Pods 1-2 and 3-4 players from Pods 3-5.\nIn games that are more competitive, I try to not have more than one player from Pod 5 on the field at one time. I tend to give more points to Pods 1-2 with 5-7 of them on the line at a time for offensive points. Occasionally I\u0026rsquo;ll mix in pod 3-4 players with veteran throwers or cutters to give some rest. More frequently, I would put in an entire line of young players to give rest to all of Pods 1-2 at the same time. They play defense and are given chances to work together as a unit at practice prior to the tourney. Their job is to make life difficult for the opposing O and hopefully score, but making the other O work hard was the primary goal. If we can steal points with this line, all the better. Basically, I \u0026ldquo;go for\u0026rdquo; some D points by loading up with Pods 1-2 and then hope to get a couple of points out of the younger D line throughout the game.\nBy using this pod system, I attempt to keep my veterans fresh for late in the tourney when they may have to play multiple points in a row while keeping young players involved in the action and giving them an opportunity to take ownership of making a difference in the game. The best way for a young player to increase playing time in this system and move from say Pod 4 to Pod 2 is for her to exert effort on D, catch the disc, and complete the next pass consistently.\n"

  "issue": "008",
  "content": "I am a firm believer that anticipation and focus are the most important elements for successful catching. I\u0026rsquo;ll leave it to others to discuss the finer points of catching techniques.\nFor anticipation, not only do you want to anticipate where the disc is headed, but you have to prepare your body for an anticipated catch. Anticipating the disc\u0026rsquo;s path is basically reading the disc. You need to be able to judge accurately how fast the disc is traveling and along what trajectory so that you can meet it at the best point possible, which is usually the earliest point possible.\nOne tip that has proved invaluable time and time again for reading a high disc is to position yourself so you can see an edge along the side of the disc. The plane that the edge of the disc is on will determine where it lands once you factor in how fast it\u0026rsquo;s moving, so make sure you can see the line the edge forms so you can predict where it will travel.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important to practice reading a disc so that you know when to jump to catch a huck at your higest point possible. Even more important (because it applies to more catches during a game) is to practice reading the speed of low passes so that you can change the angle of your cut while the disc is in mid- air so you meet every pass as soon as you can. Attacking the disc by taking the shortest path will enable you to keep your defender on your back and shield the disc from D bids.\nPreparing your body for a catch is an often overlooked element of catching. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen a number of players drop passes because they were concentrating so hard on running to the disc as fast as they can (which involves pumping your arms to your side) that they hadn\u0026rsquo;t prepared their hands for a catch (which involves your hands out in front of you) by the time they reached the disc. You have to anticipate when and where you\u0026rsquo;re going to reach the disc and already be ready to catch the disc when that time/space arrives.\nThis does not mean stopping to wait for the disc to get to you. Instead, it often means propelling yourself through the air with your last step so that you have time in the air to concentrate on the watching the disc into your hands. I am always a fan of catching the disc with both feet off the ground, mid-stride whenever possible. This gives your body, hands, and eyes the appropriate time to prepare for the catch.\nFocus as it applies to catching is simple. Watch the disc all the way into your hands. All the way. And never try to assess where you\u0026rsquo;re going to throw your next pass before you have the disc firmly in your hand(s).\n"

  "author": "Chris Talarico",
  "issue": "008",
  "content": "The best thing I ever heard of for improving your receiving skills is this game called \u0026ldquo;catch\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no replacement for repetition. You just have to do it over and over until you forget what it\u0026rsquo;s like to drop a frisbee.\nThe next step is simulating game situations. Personally, I feel like the most valuable catch to be 100% on is the in-cut: running full speed toward a disc coming at you. It\u0026rsquo;s probably the most common play in the game, but can be an extremely difficult catch with a defender breathing down your neck There are two things to work on here: making the catch out in front of your chest with arms extended, and body position to block out the defender. Oh, and also, RUN THROUGH THE #@$*^%! DISC! Few things frustrate me more than seeing a teammate slow down to catch a pass, only to have their defender lay out in front of them for the block. It\u0026rsquo;s absolutely inexcusable.\nAnyway, you can work on running through the disc and catching with arms extended with a simple drill:\nSet up in one line in the middle of the field facing a thrower. First person in line cuts out, plants, cuts in at full speed and catches a pass from the thrower. Drills don\u0026rsquo;t get more simple than that, but I like this one because it puts the cutter on display for the rest of the team. Everyone can see him or her, and give instant feedback, criticism, or encouragement.\nBody positioning is all about feel and awareness. I think most players know the term \u0026ldquo;boxing out\u0026rdquo; from basketball and have an idea of how that applies to Ultimate. Simply, it means putting yourself between the disc and your opponent, thereby forcing them to go around you in order to get to the disc. You see this a lot on floaty passes where players are jockeying for position before the disc is low enough to jump for. What is probably less common, is applying this same principle to chest-level passes. It\u0026rsquo;s difficult to convey without seeing it and trying it, but the idea is to:\n1. Be aware of where your defender is. (Hopefully behind you, of course, but to your right or left).\n2. Determine as soon as possible where the pass is headed. (Again, to your right or left).\n3. Adjust your path to the disc so that you are always between it and your defender.\nThis means you may not take a straight line to the point where you\u0026rsquo;ll make the catch—you may veer slightly to your left (if your defender is on your left side) and catch the disc on the right side of your body, for example. It\u0026rsquo;s not a natural thing to do, and takes a lot of work to get good at.\nFinally, here\u0026rsquo;s a random tip that I learned my first year of playing: when laying out for a disc, if you can get two hands on it, do so. Grab the rim on either side of the disc. You\u0026rsquo;ll never doink a pass this way.\n"

  "title": "Catching The Pull & Transitions",
  "author": "Nancy Sun",
  "issue": "008",
  "content": "Catching The Pull\nMentally, catching the pull is often thought of as being a job that one can only mess up, but the flip side is to think of it as an opportunity for a team to jump start its offense. The seconds saved by catching the pull help to get the offense in motion before the defense can set. I think of three main steps when catching the pull:\n1. Anticipation. Learn about the opposing team\u0026rsquo;s pullers, especially focusing on the distance of their pulls and angle of the throw (I/O or O/I are the predominant favorites). Obviously prior game experience will help, but this can be learned during the course of a game just as easily.\n2. Reading and Decision Making. For the pulls that I am going to catch, I try to get my body to where I can catch the disc at chest height. I turn to face the direction of its incoming path. For whatever reason I might decide not to catch the pull (for example it is raining and/or the disc is coming in at a really steep angle) I will get my body to where I think the disc is going to be easiest to pickup and throw right away. This is easy for a floating pull that settles nicely to the ground, but for a roller, anticipating the roll and getting to the right spot can be tricky.\n3. Execution. I want to pancake the pull at chest height and close to my body. I focus on keeping my hands at 90 degree angles to each other (as opposed to parallel) to eliminate misalignment and the chance that the disc might flip out of my hands.\nTransition From Catching To Throwing\nThe ability to catch and throw as quickly as possible is often undervalued as a handler attribute. Fortunately, it is easy to practice because it can be worked on as part of any throwing drill by trying to catch and release as fast as you can.\nGetting your feet into a balanced throwing position should be done simultaneous to catching. Tenths of a second can be the difference between hitting the swing or having the mark come on to prevent you from hitting the swing.(Sidebar: from playing the Japanese women at Worlds, this was something that they all seemed to excel at). As a right-handed thrower, I mostly pancake with my right hand on top so that sliding into a backhand grip is very quick. Coming out of the pancake, right-hand on top is also the most natural and secure motion for me to enter into my forehand grip.\n"

  "author": "Mike Whitaker",
  "issue": "008",
  "content": "Catching technique and practice are often overlooked components of player development. Catching instructions generally begin and end with a demonstration of the pancake catch and calls to \u0026ldquo;use two hands,\u0026rdquo; with players left to their own devices to improve their catching through repetitions. As a coach of Kali (the University of Colorado Women\u0026rsquo;s team), I have developed a more proactive approach to teaching catching.\nThe reason for this is that drops are unforced turnovers that are preventable. Defenses are good enough at the highest levels of the game that they will consistently take the disc away from your offense. The difference between good and elite teams often comes down to who makes the fewest unforced turnovers. The corollary to that is saving turnovers, not through making the spectacular layout catch, but by increasing the margin of error for your throwers by consistently catching the discs that aren\u0026rsquo;t quite thrown perfectly. The combination of eliminating easy drops and making the slightly difficult catch more often can have a huge impact on the success of your team against similarly talented competition.\nHere are some drills that I use to work specifically on catching.\n1. First, I talk to my team about when to catch with the thumb up versus thumb down when catching one handed, with the hand position switching at approximately shoulder height.\n2. Then, I have them do a set of tens, with ten throws each of inside out forehands, inside out backhands, outside in forehands, and outside in backhands. Each throw must be caught one-handed with the hand on the side of the body where the disc arrives so that receivers get used to catching one- handed lefty and righty with discs arriving at different angles.\n3. The next step is working on catching while moving. I begin by having the player run straight at me and I throw the disc at them with some zip to get them used to catching a disc that has some speed on it. They can catch with either one or two hands in this drill. Five catches each.\n4. Then they run from left to right at a 45 degree angle toward the disc and I put the disc out in front so they have to catch it left handed. Five catches then switch to a right to left cut with right handed catches.\n5. Finally, I have the players make a 45 degree cut from left to right going away from the disc. I throw the disc out in front and high so they have to make high left handed grabs. Five catches each then switch the cutting direction to use the right hand.\nTry these drills with your team and note the numbers of drops (any time the disc touches a hand and isn\u0026rsquo;t caught) and then see if you can improve throughout the course of your season.\n"

  "author": "Miranda Roth",
  "issue": "008",
  "content": "I think that for me, the main catching technique that can be practiced (and that I have learned from coaches and taught to players) is attacking the discs with two hands, thumbs down claw-style. When I was in high school, my coach Michael Baccarini used to always say that any catch you can clap, you can catch at least a foot further in front of you if you reach out with your pinchers. I didn\u0026rsquo;t really understand why this would be important until high level college games and especially now in club when there are big time defenders on your hip, contesting, bidding, getting Ds. Now that extra foot makes the difference between a catch for me and a D for the other team.\nPracticing this and drilling for it can be done in pretty much every drill involving come-to catches—when coaching I often specify the type of catch when doing simpler drills like come-to or break mark so that we work on two hand pincher catches as well as one-hand pincher catches. Just like any skill if you don\u0026rsquo;t practice, your body and mind will have to do much more work in a game to succeed.\nSomething I\u0026rsquo;ve also found particularly helpful when practicing this type of catch is to not only think about putting your hands out to catch the disc, but to also think about where your body is in relation to your defender when you are making this type of catch. You want your body to be between the defender and the disc at all times—practicing this by adding defense to any come-to drill or doing the two-person (no defined O or D) will really help gain an understanding of this skill. If a defender not only has to go that extra foot you are gaining by extending your arms but also has to go around your body, you will be much more difficult to D and your catching percentage will increase dramatically.\n"

  "content": "Catching the disc is all about practice. If a situation comes up in a game, it\u0026rsquo;ll be much easier if you\u0026rsquo;ve done it a hundred times in practice than if it\u0026rsquo;s totally foreign to you. What that means is that you need to practice catching in game situations, not just easy, uncovered, and standing still. Practice catching the disc out in front of you, practice catching with a defender on your back, off-hand catches, in the wind, hammers, and so on. Something as silly as flutterguts can be a big help when you need to catch a bobbled or macked disc. Also, try to catch everything—on defense, tipped discs, random discs flying by during drills—and don\u0026rsquo;t give up until it hits the ground or someone else catches it. This will hone your reactions and get you in the habit of doing it automatically.\nI find it particularly beneficial to practice the things you\u0026rsquo;re weakest at. For example, I\u0026rsquo;m terrible at catching discs straight-on, where I\u0026rsquo;m running directly at a disc that\u0026rsquo;s coming straight to me. So I practice those catches constantly, during warm-ups, down-time at practice, or when I\u0026rsquo;m throwing around. They still give me trouble, but I\u0026rsquo;m a lot better than I would be if I didn\u0026rsquo;t work on them.\nDifferent types of catches allow for different margins of error. Clap catches are easier than two-hand claw catches, which are easier than one-handed catches, and so on. If you know you have tons of space from any defenders, it makes more sense to use a clap catch This is particularly true when conditions such as wind, rain, or bright sun make catching more difficult. Lots of drops happen because receivers make the catch harder than it needs to be.\nSarasota, Florida, where the UPA Club Championships have been held for years, is notoriously windy. At its worst, the disc can bounce six inches up or down in a moment. In these situations, I use what I call the \u0026ldquo;alligator catch.\u0026rdquo; I put my elbows together in front of me, with the hands spread so that my forearms make about a 90-degree angle. This way, if the disc pops up or down just before it gets to me, it\u0026rsquo;ll hit me in the forearms, and I\u0026rsquo;ll still have a good chance of catching it. If a defender\u0026rsquo;s right on my back, I won\u0026rsquo;t have that luxury. But in general, I like to use the easiest catch I can without risking getting blocked.\nOne last thing that\u0026rsquo;s intuitive to many players, but may not be obvious to others, is the influence of spin on catching. Especially if you\u0026rsquo;re catching with one hand, you want the disc to be spinning into your hand, not out of it. This means if a right-handed backhand is coming straight at you, you want to grab the disc just right of its center. The disc should \u0026ldquo;stick\u0026rdquo; to your hand; if you try to catch the same pass left of center, the disc will feel like it\u0026rsquo;s pulling out of your hand. I find it especially helpful to focus on this with throws where the direction of spin isn\u0026rsquo;t as clear, like blades and upside-down throws. You may already be doing this unconsciously, but being aware of it can make difficult or awkward catches that much easier.\n"

His sadistic assistant used to routinely fire passes at Billy Nesbitt\u0026rsquo;s head because Billy had such terrible hands; his poor hands caused his braces to cause his mouth to bleed. Sobbing, snot, and blood are not too fun to witness when you\u0026rsquo;re in sixth grade. I never wanted to be anything like poor Billy. I think he\u0026rsquo;s an orthodontist now.\nThe one catch that I know I am going to always have to make routinely, or have had made routinely, is the one where you\u0026rsquo;re coming under and the defender is breathing down your neck, and the throw is just a little bit too high, like an arm length and a half too high, and you have to go up with your opposite hand to make the grab. In practice, in various drills, I try and go opposite hand on anything that\u0026rsquo;s floaty. However, it\u0026rsquo;s the ones that are down around the laces that give me the most trouble and the types I continue to work on.\nI was Chris Hinkle\u0026rsquo;s teammate on Ring of Fire for four seasons and what constantly impressed me and what I continue to try and emulate was his ability to come under at full speed and make the catch down around the laces with one hand, usually his opposite hand, switch hands while establishing the pivot, and be ready to deliver and get rid of the disc in what seemed like one complete motion. Obviously it was his baseball background that made it look effortless and easy. More often than not, I\u0026rsquo;d have to slide in to the catch, awarded a nice strawberry on the right cheek for doing so. But if the throw was right (wrong actually) and the separation was enough, fielding the disc usually worked and it felt good switching hands and moving the disc before \u0026ldquo;stalling 3\u0026rdquo; was uttered.\nAnd for my own play, for my role, the seemingly easy catches are always the most important.\n"

  "content": "The fundamental catch most players at the elite level of the game is one where you are running hard back to the disc with a defender on your back pressing you to keep your maximum speed until after the reception. The basic component to catching this is the mentality of attacking the disc.\nI have seen many players drop this by trying to finesse the Frisbee into their hands rather than aggressively securing it, whether with a \u0026ldquo;clap catch\u0026rdquo; or a \u0026ldquo;tiger claw\u0026rdquo; technique. A very simple drill to improve this as a team is setting up lines where you run at throwers who try to deliver crisp passes right at your chest. Each individual must press themselves to push all the way through the reception, rather than slowing up at the end, allowing a block for a defender in a game situation. If any fear of attacking the disc in this situation can be eliminated at practice, it will certainly bode well for in- game performance.\nBeyond attacking the disc there are basic hand-eye coordination elements which will help players improve their catching. Hand-eye coordination can be improved, and there are no shortage of ways to challenge you to get hands reacting to what the eye sees. Some ideas for things to try when just playing catch are always catching with one hand (i.e. 10 passes with the left, then 10 with the right) regardless of where the disc is thrown, trying to catch the opposite side of the disc than you would normally catch (based on the spin) or changing which hand you put on top when clap-catching. Training the body to get outside it\u0026rsquo;s comfort zone will make some difficult in-game situations more natural.\nFinally, playing catching reaction games, whether with a disc or ball or anything actually, will help the hands respond to new situations and improve their ability to react to what the eye sees, rather than thinking through a particular catch.\n"

  "title": "Regimented Catching Practice",
  "author": "Adam Goff",
  "issue": "008",
  "content": "Just like throwing, catching comes from practice.\nHow often do you see someone throwing before a game focus really hard on the throw and not on the catch? You\u0026rsquo;ll hear this player swear and scream when they miss a throw, and then catch the throw that came back with one hand while joking with the person next to them.\nOn Z, we used to do the a throwing medley at the start of every practice and every game. This throwing drill consisted of 50 throws and 50 catches for each person. It involved circling so that you saw every wind. That was more throws and catches than most players had during the rest of the day. Everyone on the team knew this because the captains reminded us. So, everyone did it and focused on it. During that medley I made sure that I leaned in to catches, leaned and stretched in, used two hands when it was right. If you were lazy, someone yelled at you. So, you caught the disc. This works for some and not others, but it worked with that team for years.\nAs someone who primarily played near the disc as a handler, I definitely felt that I was a little lucky in the area of catching. The difficulty of catching dumps and swings is definitely lower than that of catching come-backs. The two most critical components of the catch were focus and positioning rather than skills with the hands. Body positioning, for me, primarily consisted of making sure that I got my body between the disc and my defender. This enabled me to make the catch that I wanted to make. I\u0026rsquo;d work on catching while leaning in, either with the claw catch or the pancake. I practice that in the medley and I used it in the games. Dump and swing throws were usually targeted for around the shoulder height, because they are tougher to D. Again, something to focus on.\nFor me, I thought of catching as fairly regimented. If the catch was between the knees and eyes, then it was a pancake. If it was over the eyes, it was two hands (claw), usually with one hand stopping it while the other grabbed it. If it was lower or a layout, than I worked to get 4 fingers instead of a thumb under the rim. That\u0026rsquo;s how it was going to be caught, so that\u0026rsquo;s how I practiced it.\nThe other thing that I thought was important, and especially important for a handler was the ability to turn a catch into a throw extremely quickly. Again, practice it.\n"

  "author": "Lou Burruss",
  "issue": "008",
  "content": "It is a common misperception that catching cannot be taught. Learning how to catch comes down to repetition and focus. Here are two quick drills for teaching new players to catch and for honing experienced players\u0026rsquo; skills.\nThe first drill (unnamed) involves two people and ten (or more) discs. The players (thrower and catcher) stand about two yards apart. The thrower tosses disc after disc to the catcher. The thrower should place the discs so that the catcher is forced to catch high, low, left, right, one- and two-handed. Then switch the thrower and catcher. Repeat.\nThe second drill, called Throwing 100s, is a small piece of Kung Fu Throwing. Stand about two yards away from your partner and start throwing a disc back and forth as fast as you can. Don\u0026rsquo;t change your grip and move the location of your throws around, just as in the first drill. Complete 100 throws each. It\u0026rsquo;s fun to run this as a race at practice. (Start over if you drop one).\nDeveloping and maintaining focus is a huge topic and one that deserves its own column, but I\u0026rsquo;ll leave you with a couple thoughts. Practice how you want to play on game day. If you don\u0026rsquo;t extend to catch a disc in warm ups, you probably won\u0026rsquo;t extend in a game either. And always remember what my dad, Bill Burruss, taught me: \u0026ldquo;If you touch it, you should catch it.\u0026rdquo;\n"

  "title": "A Couple Of Thoughts On Zone D",
  "author": "Ben Wiggins",
  "issue": "007",
  "content": "A couple of quick thoughts.\nSidelines are great for communication, but the people that need to be able to talk to each other are all on the field already. In a standard three-person cup, the communication streams are simple:\nDeep talks to wings and short-deep Short-deep talks to points and middle Middle talks to points Wings talk to their side\u0026rsquo;s point With these streams, each player can adjust the positioning of the players they are covering for. If I am at short-deep, and have two players to cover, I can cover one by letting the middle-cup know which way to move, and I can cover the other player. I\u0026rsquo;ll usually use the middle-cup to cover the player I am farther away from. This isn\u0026rsquo;t just lazyness. They can cover in two steps what it would take me 8-9 full-speed committed steps to stop, and they can do it in less than half the time.\nThis player has to trust me, though. If I say \u0026ldquo;right,\u0026rdquo; I need them to physically move to their right by at least a step and a half. If they just look there, they can be assured that they will often look back at the thrower only to see that the disc is in that hole, flying by.\nI played in college with Josh Greenough, who was a dominating middle cup, and incredibly responsive. I could bait throws for him by waiting just a split- second longer to tell him about the threat. Instead of, \u0026ldquo;Josh, Right,\u0026rdquo; I would wait\u0026hellip;\u0026ldquo;Josh, Bid Right.\u0026rdquo; He\u0026rsquo;d hit the air without looking, and the shocked handler might even hit him in the chest with it. Meanwhile, I\u0026rsquo;m moving to cover for Josh; if the handler pulled it back successfully and tries for that hole, I\u0026rsquo;m on it.\nOne thing about zone D is that unless you run an upfield trap (trying to catch a wing on the sideline, for instance) you are probably keeping the disc in the hands of the best players on the other team. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen many teams go zone because the other team is scoring from one star to another, and this just lets those two stars play catch, but now without any pressure.\nI love using the same zone, but with different focuses on different points. Example: I\u0026rsquo;ll use a 2-3-2 zone, with the cup attacking handler-to-handler throws, and the wings guarding the point-middle cup gaps. Here we are trying to give our points opportunities to get handblocks, and force them to go through the cup. Next point, same zone, but now are cup is glued to each other\u0026rsquo;s hips, allowing no throws through, and the wings are very wide and flat. Now we are forcing many throws and tempting an over the top throw.\nIf the other team scored once, they might well try to advance with the same tactics, playing right into our \u0026rsquo;new\u0026rsquo; defensive set. Plus, this kind of approach gives individual players a solid grasp of what their defensive goals are.\nWhat does a good zone point look like? You better know before you run it. Are you trying to force hammers, or yardage-losing swings? How often do you expect the other team to score easily? The original Clam was a fantastic Zone D\u0026hellip;and about every third time, they expected it to get roasted for an easy goal. The quick D points that it did generate, especially upwind, made it worthwhile. So, if you run it once and get schooled, does that mean that you should not come back to it? Depends on your expectations.\nSame with blocks; you need to know where you expect to get them. On cross- field hammers? Point-blocks? Drops on the 40th throw? Those players on your team that are not in the designated block-getter spots may play differently if they understand that their role is to generate block-getting oppportunities, and not necessarily take chances themselves. You can start running a 7-v-1 D on every throw, instead of lots of little 1-v-1\u0026rsquo;s and 2-v-2\u0026rsquo;s.\n"

  "title": "A Tweak To The 1-3-3",
  "author": "Matt Dufort",
  "issue": "007",
  "content": "With zone defenses, I tend to lean away from the old standards, reasoning that if most defenders know them, most offenses know how to play against them. Almost everyone has run a standard three-person cup, and every offense has seen one. In order to get a good offense out of its rhythm enough to generate turnovers, you need to either run a well-known zone better than other teams do, or you need to do something different.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s something different: the formation is a 1-3-3, but with a few major changes. One marker, three defenders 5-10 yards downfield from the disc (aka \u0026ldquo;first wall\u0026rdquo;), and three more defenders 15-50 yards downfield from the disc (aka \u0026ldquo;second wall\u0026rdquo;). The spacing of the defenders in the second wall is largely dependent on where the threats are, and is similar to the backfield in most other zones.\nFrom the first wall, two players step up to form a 3-man cup with the marker. The break-side player from the first wall drops into the hole immediately behind the cup. If the disc then swings to the other side of the field, he/she steps up to become part of the cup, while his/her counterpart on the other side of the field drops into that same hole behind the cup. This requires more communication and awareness, but the cup players no longer have to chase the disc back and forth across the field—instead the composition of the cup changes as the disc moves. A good marker is essential—someone who can contain break throws, but will take a risk here and there when they smell blood.\nThe defense traps the disc on both sidelines. Essentially, the marker is always forcing the disc to continue moving the same direction as the previous pass. So if the marker is forcing backhand, and gets broken by a crossfield swing, he/she just switches to forcing forehand, to keep the disc moving toward the opposite sideline. This is primarily to save energy—the marker never has to catch up to the disc to contain the flow. It also perpetuates the trap, as the easy continuation throw will usually be toward a sideline.\nMost of the turnovers generated by this zone will be from riskier throws off the sidelines. The trap uses the sideline to reduce the area that can be thrown to, and forces the offense to break through the zone just to maintain possession. My opinion is that at many levels, offenses have become patient enough that force-middle zones don\u0026rsquo;t create turnovers. Unless the team has a really bad zone offense, or the conditions make it difficult just to complete passes (extreme wind, rain, snow), a force-middle zone is just going to slow the offense down. Trapping makes things hard, takes away the easy options, and can force turnovers even from skilled, patient teams.\nThis zone has two main weaknesses. It\u0026rsquo;s not designed to contain the disc in the middle of the field, so it\u0026rsquo;s susceptible to handlers chipping the disc up the field with short two-yard gains. To prevent this, the middle player of the first wall needs to step up to make those short gains more difficult. It\u0026rsquo;s also possible for the offense to gain yards by swinging to the weak side, then taking quick upfield shots before the defense adjusts. To combat this, the side players in the first wall need to move quickly when the disc swings. If run efficiently and aggressively, this defense can fluster offenses and create lots of turnovers, without exhausting your team\u0026rsquo;s best zone D players. Lastly, it helps to have more than one alternative to man defense (either a transition or another zone set). That way, if the offense starts to figure out your zone, you can mix things up a bit to throw them off again.\n"

  "title": "Addressing Zone Questions",
  "author": "Chris Ashbrook",
  "issue": "007",
  "content": "From your experience, what zone configuration do you feel most confident in?\nIn general I prefer a three man cup mainly because it can be used to disguise other types of defensive schemes teams may use, such as a zone to man. The specific setup I prefer for the three man cup is with the short deep playing very close to the cup, if not actually part of the cup, working as a unit to trap the disc on the sideline. Ideally the short deep will float into the cup as offensive players crash the cup, and falls out further when offensive players try to extend the cup.\nWhy do you like this kind of zone? Specifically, what kinds of turnovers or blocks are you hoping to create?\nI like the zone because, and expect the turnovers to result due to:\n1. Causing the offensive team to throw and catch the disc as many times as possible. The more throws and catches the zone can cause, the more likely an errant throw or a drop becomes.\n2. Disallowing any and all throws threw the cup.\n3. Allowing, but make very difficult, around break mark throws from the handler. This causes the disc to go backwards which will allow the cup to recover.\n4. Trapping the disc on the sideline to cause a low percentage throw, and hopefully a turnover.\n5. Making the offensive team throw over the top of the cup as they are generally low percentage throws.\nIn Your Favorite Zone, what are the weak points of the zone that they are likely exploiting?\n1. They are probably throwing hammers over the top and completing them. If so, it fits into the strategy and sometimes you have to tip your cap.\n2. They might be getting a continuation throw off when a handler breaks the mark with an around throw.\nWhat adjustments, from a team-wide standpoint, can you make?\n1. Start taking the around away and make the handler beat you on a different type of throw.\n2. Possibly drop the short deep a bit further outside of the cup.\n3. Bring the deep in closer.\n4. Bring the weakside wing closer to the middle of the field.\nIf you had only enough time in one time-out to talk to a single player in your zone D, which position would that be? What might you tell them to adjust?\nTo me, the sideline is the most important player in a zone D point. Remind everyone that they need to be talking (not yelling) to a specific player in the zone. Everyone should pick out a player to talk to so that the player is not receiving conflicting instructions.\nThe on field player that I talk to most is the short-deep. He has to be very vocal to the wings and to the cup. He should be looking around, directing the cup as to threats so they can position themselves appropriately. He also must pass players off to the wings and deep, so the communication has to be excellent. I would remind him to be very active in vocalizing what he sees.\nThe second person I would talk to would be the deep. The deep needs to be vocal to identify the threats to the short deep and the wings they can\u0026rsquo;t see as the offensive player slips in back of the short deep and/or wings.\n"

  "author": "Adam Goff",
  "issue": "007",
  "content": "Choosing a favorite zone depends on a few factors, including the personnel on my team, the personnel on the other team, the direction and strength of the wind, and the things the other team are doing that are working. Every team should have two different zone looks in their arsenal, ideally with a well practiced ability to transition out of the zone into a person defense. Choosing a zone is another question though, so I\u0026rsquo;ll go with the classic—the 2-3-2. To make sure we\u0026rsquo;re all thinking the same, the 2-3-2 is the name for what is usually thought of as the \u0026lsquo;standard zone\u0026rsquo;—a three person cup made up of 2 points or markers and a top-of-the-cup or middle-middle, two wings and two deeps, usually deployed as a deep and a short-deep. I like this zone for a few reasons:\n1. The zone can be played very simply.\nIt is easy to reduce the positions in the zone to very specific responsibilities. The cup can\u0026rsquo;t let the disc through and up the middle; the wings have to prevent the disc from going up the sidelines after a swing; the deep has to protect from the long throws. The short-deep is a bit less specific, but has a very defined area of responsibility. Of course, there are more complexities than this when choosing when to take chances, how to trap or how to transition, but it is still easy to define responsibilities.\n2. It is easy to communicate.\nBecause positions are well defined, it is easy for people both on and off the field to help the players in this zone with good directions. A well practiced team is able to do this with whatever zone that they are using, but the 2-3-2 has some very obvious, basic responsibilities that make this easy to do. With any zone (any D, really), communication is the key to success and this zone makes that easy.\nThe 2-3-2 is really designed to force the other team to complete a lot of passes and get opportunistic blocks. At the top levels, teams aren\u0026rsquo;t going to give the disc back a lot just because they have to throw a lot of passes. A very strong wind will help, but it still takes a bit more work. Many of the turns that I\u0026rsquo;m hoping to see will be due to impatience—trying something a bit tougher that gets blocked after a lot of throws that didn\u0026rsquo;t get a lot. The other D\u0026rsquo;s will be due to a change—someone on the defense doing something opportunistic that is a little different. For example, when everyone on the D does exactly what they are supposed to for 5-8 swings in a row, the offense may get a touch complacent. The wing then cheats in and swipes that next swing when the handler didn\u0026rsquo;t quite look him or her off. This can be done all over the field, but it relies on the rest of the team being ready to cover up when the player takes a chance.\nTwo weaknesses of the 2-3-2: First, if the disc gets downfield of the cup (either over the top or through the middle), the offense often has more players available than there are defenders. With three defenders in the cup behind the disc and likely one or both of the wings off toward the sidelines, it is common that the two deeps are contending with three offensive players. Adjustments for this can include the short-deep being very aggressive, almost joining the cup to make going through even that much harder or ensuring that the wings push towards the middle whenever possible. This forces the wings to recover very quickly if the disc swings. This is because the second key weakness is that on a swung disc, there aren\u0026rsquo;t a lot of defenders over there until the cup catches up. Fortunately, there usually are enough defenders, as long as the wing and short deep shift with the swing. This article isn\u0026rsquo;t really about how to play all of the positions, but as the throw up the sideline is the most dangerous throw against this zone, it is critical that the wing move to the sideline as the throw goes up. If the wing is in position, and the short-deep has moved over as well, the cup doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to sprint with every throw. This enables the cup stay together as a unit longer and keeps them from tiring.\nOften, if a team is beating the zone, I encourage the team to get back to the basics of the zone—focus on the responsibilities listed above, as it is often a breakdown in the simple responsibilities that is creating the problem. Outside of that, I consider using a transition (zone-for-five), switching zones or alternating D\u0026rsquo;s.\nIf you had only enough time in one time-out to talk to a single player in your zone D, which position would that be? What might you tell them to adjust? It\u0026rsquo;s hypothetical—so here are two answers: If the disc is going up the sideline for yards, I talk to the wing. This typically means that the wing isn\u0026rsquo;t recovering to cover an offensive player on the sideline fast enough on a swing. I usually tell the wing to \u0026rsquo;look for that person with your whole body\u0026rsquo; when the swing goes up. This means that, when the throw goes, the wing turns and runs while looking. If there is no one over there, there will be plenty of time to get back to where s/he was. If they are going through the middle (or over the top) of the cup, I talk to the short deep. Usually it involves telling this person to get more vocal (it\u0026rsquo;s hypothetical, so I\u0026rsquo;m guessing here). If the short deep gets too quiet, not helping the cup adjust, then the disc can get through the middle more easily.\nAs a final aside: I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to answer this question without getting into too many details about the difference between Women\u0026rsquo;s, Open, and Mixed. I touched on Mixed specifics in Feature No. 1. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t change a lot of the basics of the 2-3-2 from Open to Women\u0026rsquo;s. I might lean a bit more towards a 1-3-3 or a transition in Open though.\n"

  "author": "Greg Husak",
  "issue": "007",
  "content": "I believe that it is impossible to design a zone (or any defense for that matter) that takes away everything. If I knew that zone I would never lose a game. I think the important thing about a zone is to make sure that everyone is clear of what the zone\u0026rsquo;s objectives are, and when they are forced to make a decision on the field, they do it within the context of that zone.\nFor instance, there might be a zone that encourages the other team to move side-to-side, swinging the disc but is stingy about the upfield. There might be another that really plugs up the short stuff and forces a huck. The defense only has a limited amount of resources (defenders) and so you have to decide how to distribute those resources throughout the field. The best zone is one that all the players understand and run well together.\nThe zone I would choose would depend somewhat on the other team\u0026rsquo;s strengths, but also on the best zone in our team\u0026rsquo;s arsenal. Typically this has been a zone which puts resources up front, at the expense of fewer people helping on deep hucks. We might allow the disc to move side-to-side, even for short yards, but primarily stopping mid-range (10-20 yards) shots directly up field to receivers. Hopefully frustration will set in and the offense will decide to let one go on an ill-advised deep shot that we have a good chance at pulling down. If there is a bit of tricky wind, we may even get lucky with a relatively unforced error, brought on by the fact that the offense is throwing a lot of safe passes.\nPatient offenses may be able to wear the defense down and chip away up the field to score, or even exploit a seam and then have an advantage behind the defense (again, with resources put forward if the disc gets behind the wings there is a lot of open space). A good team should have a zone to complement their bread and butter, one which redistributes those resources on the field to take away something else. Typically though, if there is one position which could be easily adjusted to take away a different option it is the mark. By making the mark tighter/looser or having him shift to prevent/allow a swing the defense can take a different shape with some ease.\n"

  "title": "The Four-Person Cup",
  "author": "Miranda Roth",
  "issue": "007",
  "content": "For most of my teams (coaching and playing) we have been most comfortable in a 4-person cup recently. The goal with this zone is to prevent throws through the cup or around it with yardage gainers—we want to force the throws backward and we want to force a lot of them. I was taught to see this as a math problem—even the simplest throw will only be completed 99% of the time (.99 possibility of completion). Two of these same passes will be completed .99*.99 times (.9801 possibility of completing both passes). So you can easily see that with more passes, the chance of turnovers increases and, of course, if you or the conditions are forcing more difficult throws the completion rate for each pass goes down which translates to an increase in chance of turnover (i.e. the same throw on a windy/rainy day is only .8 possibility of completion).\nIn addition to the math, I feel very comfortable with this zone with the personnel that I\u0026rsquo;ve had on my recent teams—lots of tall people with strong marks that are difficult to throw over. Sometimes we also run a variation of this in the 1-3-3 trapping zone that forces the same looks as the 4-person cup, but also encourages the disc to go toward typically weaker throwers (side poppers/wings instead of primary handlers) in a trap situation.\nIn both of these zones, the weak points are always creating numbers advantages behind the cup/1-3. If two handlers can easily break it through a 4-person cup, then there is a 5 on 3 downfield advantage for the offense. If this happens, then we typically transition out immediately (on a yardage-gaining break), or after it happens more than once (on short breaks).\nFrom a team-wide standpoint, the adjustments that we like to make after teams start breaking through this is to transition to a similar but different zone—dropping one of the cuppers back into a very short short-deep position if they are gaining from short breaks or perhaps a box-and-one if one handler in particular is breaking through the zone repeatedly.\nOften times the positions that have to work the hardest and need the most feedback in both of my favorite zones are the wings—they are in charge of covering the most field and based on the offense we are playing against they will get very different looks. I think that the wings in the zone can make or break the defense—making it with hustle, communication, and awareness.\n"

The wind started mild on Thursday and picked up through the week. One of my teammates on Trigger Hippy, Scott \u0026ldquo;the Kid\u0026rdquo; Runkel (who played for Boston back when they were Big Brother, and, as far as I know, was the original \u0026ldquo;the Kid\u0026rdquo; of the three that I know), along with Mike \u0026ldquo;the Wizard\u0026rdquo; Faris, came up with a zone to man to zone to man, etc. D called the Wham!, made specifically for Sarasota.\nIn a nutshell, Wham! stands for Woman-Clam. A fluctuating D that changes from a lane-cluttering Clam, to a Man-to-Man depending on what gender has the disc and whether it\u0026rsquo;s on the force sideline, or not.\nSexist? Maybe. Effective? Absolutely! Everyone on the team needed to have some upper-level field awareness, and the sideline had to be loud, and quick to holler, \u0026ldquo;Man, Man, Man\u0026rdquo; then, \u0026ldquo;Wham, Wham, Wham\u0026rdquo; when a woman cutter (who was also not a strong handler) received the disc trapped on the sideline. A hard, trapping mark would rotatie to a \u0026rsquo;no around\u0026rsquo; position (forcing sideline). A deep poacher and a pinching handler defender would usually force the thrower to make a difficult I/O throw upwind, or fire one down field to a deep poacher.\nTurnover, jailbreak, score. Repeat.\nIt is very arguable that the skillset and talent has increased exponentially since 2001. However, for a team of cagey and wily veterans from the mountains, this was a veritable \u0026lsquo;fatality\u0026rsquo; to the offense of teams running a vertical stack in 2001 with the wind howling and swirling in their face. Obviously, we still had to have the skills to score up and downwind.\nWould this be as effective now as it was then? Maybe: with a fast, athletic defense that has a great supporting sideline. It could be effective as a tempo changing defense to throw the offense out of their comfort zone.\n"

  "content": "A trap cup zone is a common and effective configuration in Mixed Ultimate. It looks to create pressure and mismatches at the disc. The handlers, who touch the disc most in zone offense, are depended upon by the rest of the team to be consistent and unflappable when working a zone D. An aggressive trap cup can serve to fluster and frustrate the handlers, whether it\u0026rsquo;s because they themselves are having trouble moving the disc or because others are having trouble getting them the disc. When the handlers become uncomfortable, the rest of the offense snowballs along with them. Often a trap cup will focus on: (1) forcing in the direction where the wind is making the swing throws easier so that breaking the mark/cup back the other direction is very difficult and (2) forcing the disc to the sideline where there is a female handler and/or a weaker thrower (not necessarily a handler).\nIn the presented scenario where the wind is unpredictable, the D will probably focus on (2). The idea is to put 1-2 people (usually men) in the cup who have exceptional marks and are difficult to get around. The defense is hoping to create hand and foot blocks (especially against female handlers where a difference in physical size lends itself more easily to these types of blocks) as well as force poor execution and/or decision-making that result in discs either getting turfed or caught in the wind. In addition, while the mark is making it tougher to get a throw off, the rest of the cup is creating even more of a challenge by taking away typical go-to throws (the dump, the crash, and the IO, for example). The first and most natural thing the offense will want to do is get it around the mark or through the cup since going over the top in these conditions would seemingly be a very low percentage choice. But with so much pressure on the thrower as well as on the other bailout positions, everyone crowds the disc, the field gets smaller, and then urgency and panic lead to blocks and turns.\nThe downfield of this zone is usually set up with the men in the middle of the field and women on the wings. This is because the defenders in the middle of the field tend to have to cover more ground than the wings and men typically can do this more effectively. Your deep-deep should be the guy with speed and ups who can cover ground and pull high, floaty throws out of the air. Your short-deep is preferably quick and squirrelly due to the fact that most teams have their best cutter(s) popping; a highly reflexive layout trigger would also be an advantage at short-deep since throws up the middle are usually shorter and happen quickly, leaving little time to process and respond to them. Wings need to have a lot of field awareness since they have to cover their sideline as well as help out the short-deep and deep-deep depending on where the disc is, where the offense is cutting, and how the genders are set up. They have to communicate a lot with those defending the middle of the field so that everyone knows what their defensive priority is.\nAs is obvious from the name of the configuration, the effectiveness of trap cup zone D depends largely on the cup. When the cup is moving, it has to do so as a unit to avoid opening up holes through it. There will almost always be men and women in the cup; therefore the members of the cup face the challenge of finding a happy medium in the pace that they run so they can both move quickly across the field and stay together. Also, the cup has to communicate effectively about when to put the trap on and who will be guarding what during the trap. If either of these points is not coordinated, the zone is more likely to fall apart. Getting the cup in sync takes practice, which is why having a handful of players who specialize at running the cup together will only help to make your zone stronger. But until this sort of oneness becomes natural for the cup, it is vulnerable.\nDepending on how the cup is being breached, a couple of things could need adjusting:\n1. The members of the cup might need to mark up differently on the handler(s)/those closest to the disc in order to take away the throw or move that is consistently breaking them. 2. The short-deep might need to communicate better where the cuts are coming in, direct the cup where to go, and plug whatever hole that might create. 3. The strong-side wing might need to step up to help out the cup and/or short-deep, which means that the deep-deep might need to drift to the strong-side to help out the wing, and the weak-side wing might need to pull back and pinch into the center a bit more to help out the deep-deep.\nIf there was time to talk to just one player during a time-out, it would be to tell the mark what throw(s) from what player(s) are hurting us at the moment and to shift the appropriate way to take it away, thus hopefully re- establishing a feeling of discomfort and frustration at once again not allowing them to throw what they want. All other adjustments on the field domino from whatever the mark is doing. If you\u0026rsquo;ve prepared your zone well, everyone else on the field should know what to do and where to be based on how the mark positions himself.\n"

  "issue": "007",
  "content": "Zone Basics\nI\u0026rsquo;ve always been a fan of a good trapping zone, but in unpredictable winds even a very conservative and basic zone would produce turns. There are way too many specifics and permutations to cover in this forum, but below are three principles of a trapping zone.\nBasically, a trapping zone consists of three things. First, how are you going to allow the disc to move to a sideline. This is a combination of making it hard to move the disc in the middle, and making a lateral throw an easy pass without giving up too many yards.\nSecond, how are you going to apply pressure once you are on the sideline. This typically involves shifting the cup to take away easy dumps, and shifting the remaining downfield defenders to the strong side so that the only remaining options are a short pass that looses yardage, or a long throw over many defenders to the weak side.\nFinally, how are you going to contain when the disc moves off sideline or downfield. A lateral throw can often be contained, but everyone needs to react and take away the next throw, and not the one that was just thrown. For downfield throws, the deep and wings can often be most effective by just covering a person, instead of an area. The primary goal is to prevent other downfield passes, then re-establish containment with zone coverage.\nAdjustments\nOne adjustment would be to have a zone-to-man transition, or just run man a couple points. Once a team starts to figure a zone out, they will gain confidence through repetition. The easiest way to counter this is to give them and entirely different look for a few points. Unless you have an entirely different zone set, this usually means a zone to man transition, or just man for the entire point.\nIf you had only enough time in one time-out to talk to a single player in your zone D, which position would that be? What might you tell them to adjust?\nThe best person to talk to would be the short deep, or whoever the defender is that is right behind the cup. Most zones get hosed when the disc moves to the place you least want it to move. For a trapping zone this is upfield when it is in the middle, or across the entire field when it is trapped. The former is really the short deep\u0026rsquo;s responsibility, as he is in the best position to joystick the cup defenders whose main objective is to make a wall and deny the middle of the field. Again, there are so many permutations, but essentially you will need to adjust your positioning to take away more of the middle, while giving the offense more of an opportunity to move laterally.\n"

  "issue": "007",
  "content": "Pike ran an imposing 1-3-3 for a number of years, a set that may or may not have morphed into a 4-man cup at times. Mike Jaeger (formerly of Michigan, currently of Sockeye) was great at the one spot.\nThe Warrior squad I played for in 2001 ran a 1-3-3 as well and that look got us to Nationals. Rhett Russ also the right man for the one spot. I\u0026rsquo;m a fan of the 1-3-3. I also like a 4-man cup but that set is extremely difficult to run more than one or two times a game/tournament. With the right sideline and the right wind, it\u0026rsquo;s a test to see what those back three can do.\nHowever, I\u0026rsquo;ll go with the \u0026ldquo;2-3-2 configururation.\u0026rdquo; In the semis of College Nationals in 1991, UNC-Wilmington was down 4-10 to Cornell at halftime. UNCW ended up winning 19-11. Much of what those UNC-W teams did at the time was done so at the altar of NYNY, especially our zone defense.\nNYNY ran their zone up wind or down wind, breezy or calm They always ran 2-3-2. It\u0026rsquo;s been well-documented that we studied \u0026lsquo;89 finals tape. Down 14-16, NY slaps on the 2-3-2. 16 all. At 17 all, they roll 3 for 20-17. Final 21-19. In 1988 versus Sweden in a game to 17, Sweden is receiving and up 16-15. 2-3-2. 18-16 NYNY. In 1990 versus the Iguanas, the results were similar, and although their completion percentage was high, Southern Cal still lost by five. And again in 1993 at Worlds versus Rhino, NYNY I think was down 9-14 before their 2-3-2 won the game. (And certainly that game was a statement game for Rhino. They faced NYNY in the 92 semifinalss; NYNY with zero first half turns, and 2 for the game).\nAnd then the Greatest Game Ever Played: NY Cojones vs Boston, semifinals 1994. 2-3-2 from each team throughout much of the contest; obviously 1-3-3 and Clam from Boston as well. Cojones scores upwind vs zone to tie at 17s. Boston going upwind with no timeouts. 28 passes later they are up one and pulling downwind, game to 19. 2-3-2 set and Boston\u0026rsquo;s cup: John Bar and Jethro points, and Lenny at the all-important middle-middle. 38 passes later, Lenny swats down a laser through the cup, game over.\nGreat 2-3-2s aren\u0026rsquo;t seen very often anymore. Perhaps this is due to the fashionable spread offenses or the 175 gram that nearly everyone can rip 90 yards. And maybe it\u0026rsquo;s just because teams simply can\u0026rsquo;t play it or the fact that DoG\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;death to dump swing zone offense\u0026rdquo; has erased it as an option. Perhaps a little bit of all.\nThe meat of the set begins with the cup. It\u0026rsquo;s not random selection. NYNY role players earned their play time here and they were conditioned to play these positions: Andy Scheman, Walter van der Schraaf, Blair O\u0026rsquo;Conner, Paul Shields, Jon Gewirtz, Ken Dobyns. Scheman and O\u0026rsquo;Conner were meant to play the points and it\u0026rsquo;s clear they resigned themselves to suffer until the point was over; good for one or two blocks a game.\nDobyns and Walter, and Boston\u0026rsquo;s Lenny Engel played the middle-middle position that always demonstrated why this set is called 2-THREE-2, and not 3-2-2. Those three along with Chain\u0026rsquo;s Stu Downs were more than artistic in this slot. The middle-mid is the drummer, the venerable Charlie Watts.\nI think the short-deep is good for one sneaky block. One or two members of the cup will get a one block, but more than likely they will force a bad throw by playing the stall count. I don\u0026rsquo;t want the deep-deep to get any blocks, unless it\u0026rsquo;s coming under and he is the guy I talk to in the time-out. Too often you see a deep-deep come under with the O player ¼ to ½ in and then stop. A block is being given up here. Let the sideline call for help and get a wing to drop back.\nMy team-wide adjustment: In a perfect world, I\u0026rsquo;d have a pair on each sideline talking to the wings. A1 is watching the field talking to the wing while A2 is looking across the field at the opposite wing and waiting for the time he has to tell A1 to tell their wing to drop back. Got that?\nThe weaknesses are your wings getting sucked in, a deep-deep getting too cocky and baiting, or getting bored like a 6th grade goalie, and your points having their lower body give out on them. Break marks on high counts, lunging at fakes, and being out of step with the middle-mid; otherwise you\u0026rsquo;ll have an overzealous handler jack a hammer for a block, a wing look upfield that second prior to his catch, or a popper run a give-and-go right in to the sod.\n"

  "content": "In every sport (save cycling and aquatics) there is an element of footwork that goes into the skills and techniques that an athlete develops. In baseball it is the timing of a batter waiting for a pitch. In football, it is the cornerback pedaling backwards, shuffling sideways, sprinting all-out, and the transitions in between.\nIn Ultimate footwork has become more and more of a priority for individual players at the elite level. Efficiencies with your legs on defense can mean the difference between getting a block and giving up an easy goal. Being able to effectively pivot with the disc in your hands can mean getting a throw off before stall 10.\nIn this issue of \u0026quot;The Huddle,\u0026quot; we have asked our authors to discuss examples of good footwork on the field and what we can do to improve, illustrate who they have seen that demonstrates superior skills in this manner, and show us what may be some telltale signs of poor form.\n"

  "content": "I still remember being at Worlds in 1999 in Scotland and it was sort of the debut of Fortunat Mueller with Boston. He was a young workhorse at that time and DoG knew how to use him, as he was probably catching half their goals. I remember watching a pool play game of theirs and a more experienced player pointing out his footwork, how he was always on balance. While we had begun some very basic footwork drills, it was the first time I remember noticing someone\u0026rsquo;s footwork in a game situation. Footwork became a critical component of our training after that as its value became more clear, and it\u0026rsquo;s an easy thing to work on and improve.\nGood footwork not only helps you stay on balance and and allows you to change directions easily, it also allows you to be more explosive because your feet are in the right positions to make explosive moves. The key is to practice it so that in games you are doing the right things without thinking about it.\nPracticing good footwork can come in a variety of ways. Obvious things are ladders and hurdles, which will improve your footspeed. Simple cone patterns of direction changing, or even having reaction direction changing can reinforce footwork in a change of direction situation. Weight distribution is also important, and to this end getting a player off-balance or extended and having them find their balance point is helpful. Then there are more extreme things like one of my teammates (Chris Frost) who goes for runs in dry creekbeds to work on his foot placement and strengthening his ankles.\n"

  "author": "Miranda Roth",
  "issue": "006",
  "content": "The player that has excellent footwork in my mind has a football and track background. He has great body positioning while cutting that I think leads to his strong footwork. His cuts are strong as a result of pushing his weight into the ground and exploding after getting low and chopping his feet. This helps his play because I believe he is able to get open on players that are bigger and stronger and faster than him by using good technical footwork.\nIn my own game, my footwork is very important. Because I have developed myself into a deep cutter and mid-range receiver and thrower, my defender does not know where I\u0026rsquo;m going to cut in an ideal world. Typically defenders play me just on the force side, not necessarily fronting or backing. Because of this I have to make some kind of fake to cut anywhere. Generally I move into the space a few feet away from the stack to make my move (or in spread, a few feet away from the sideline). Then I either get low, chop my feet, and explode or shake and bake (I think this is more effective for me because it plays to my power cutting and gets faster defenders on their heels).\nI think more than any drills, thinking about cutting and training explosivitiy is key. If you can envision yourself making a strong cut, you will be able to do that. Cutting drills will help this come to fruition.\n"

  "issue": "006",
  "content": "A big part of footwork is quickness, and the best tool I know of to improve quickness is a speed ladder. I would highly recommend getting one—the longer the better. The various drills and exercises are pretty easy to find and learn, and they\u0026rsquo;re pretty fun to do.\nYou can just Google \u0026ldquo;speed ladder drills\u0026rdquo; and you\u0026rsquo;ll get plenty of sites that do a far better job of explaining the drills than I can. Then get your team on it: warm up, stretch, then run through the exercises at the beginning of practice or workouts. I\u0026rsquo;m no fitness expert, but I\u0026rsquo;ve heard it\u0026rsquo;s better to work on speed and quickness at the beginning of a work out as opposed to the end when you\u0026rsquo;re tired and less likely to use proper form. Whether that\u0026rsquo;s entirely true or not, I\u0026rsquo;ll leave for you to decide.\nAnyway, you can get by with one ladder for your team, though I prefer not to run more than 10 people on a ladder just to keep the down time to a minimum, so two usually works better when you\u0026rsquo;ve got your whole team together. I guarantee you\u0026rsquo;ll see results. (Note: Results not guaranteed in any real or meaningful way).\nAs for individual footwork \u0026ldquo;moves,\u0026rdquo; one that can help make cuts sharper is planting off your inside foot instead of your outside foot (or a cross-over step). For example, say you\u0026rsquo;re setting up a cut to the left by heading to your right. When you\u0026rsquo;re ready to change direction, the typical move is to jab your right foot out to plant and push off to the left. Try this instead: place your last step with your left foot under your center of gravity, or more to the right of where it would land if you were running straight ahead. Rotate your hips hard to the left, and swing your right leg around to make your next step roughly 90 degrees from your original path. It will also help to get low and dip your left shoulder as you make the move. You should see that this will allow you to change direction quicker than with a jab step.\n"

  "issue": "006",
  "content": "Improving footwork is just one of many ways to improve quickness and efficiency on offense and defense. Other ways to improve quickness and efficiency include weight training, plyos to train muscles often overlooked/underused, learning to lower your center of gravity, core strengthening, and balance. As a team, Truck Stop has chosen to focuses on some of these other factors to improve quickness and efficiency.\nHowever, there are two instances where I think a focus on footwork, more so than the other factors, can vastly improve performance:\n1. 180 degree changes in direction when cutting/defending, and; 2. Pivoting as the thrower.\nA player with poor footwork in these instances will require more steps than a player with good footwork, making him or her slower and less efficient.\nGood 180 degree direction changes—going full speed one direction, slowing, planting, and accelerating to full speed in the opposite direction—can allow a cutter to create separation from a defender. Conversely, it can allow a defender to keep that from happening. I see many players taking lots of little steps to make a 180 degree turn, which inevitably makes the cuts less sharp and more round. This is slow and inefficient. Playing soccer in HS, I was taught the efficient way to make the turn was all based on footwork and that it should take only two steps to get fully turned around. Let\u0026rsquo;s say you are planting and making a turn to your right, here is what I was told to do:\n1. Plant left foot pointing at or near 90 degrees from your initial direction of motion and begin pushing off. 2. Lift right leg, rotate hips to the right. 3. Point your right knee and foot in the opposite direction, 180 degrees from your initial direction of motion, no less. Plant and push off. 4. Drive your left arm and leg in the opposite direction to accelerate.\nFocusing on the footwork during this turn will direct all of your energy in the direction you want to go instead of wasting it with extra steps in the wrong direction. I remember it becoming second nature fairly quickly.\nAs a thrower, opening up space with fakes takes more than good footwork. But sometimes all you need to get a throw around a marker is to be quicker than him/her. Even if your fakes aren\u0026rsquo;t good, focusing on footwork can give you that quickness edge to get you from open-side to break-side faster than the marker.\nAs a marker, you should learn to recognize poor footwork and bait it. In my experience, it\u0026rsquo;s the taller, lankier players and, of course, the newer players, who require extra steps. As a marker you should note poor footwork and anticipate the same footwork next time. Then, if you have good footwork, you should be able to beat the thrower to the release point to get the block.\nI do not have great fakes and am often criticized for not pivoting enough when I have the disc. Last season I came up with a little drill to do at home to improve quickness. It\u0026rsquo;s supposed to simulate throwing around a marker. I moved away the chairs to make some space in front of my kitchen table, which is about 5 feet long. Then I positioned myself in middle of the long side of the table with a disc. Focusing on quickly moving my non-pivot foot in only one step, I would fake one direction, pivot, plant, and pretend to throw by touching the short side of the table with the disc during the throwing motion. The length of the table and the need to touch the short side of the table forced me to extend out. I would repeat the drill until I felt comfortable with my footwork. Then I would do it again, positioning myself relative to the table to simulate a forehand mark, backhand mark then straight up mark.\nI further refined this learned footwork in practice against live marks. Even though my fakes are still atrocious, I now feel more confident that I can beat a marker to my throwing release point because my footwork is cleaner.\n"

  "content": "Ring of Fire\u0026rsquo;s Dave Snoke has tremendous footwork. Of course, Dave was a star soccer player for the NC State Wolfpack before switching over to Ultimate so it\u0026rsquo;s no surprise this skill is to his advantage. On offense, he constantly seems to accomplish more with less, taking the least amount of steps to get a big gain or get the O out of a tight situation, time and again. On the D side of things it\u0026rsquo;s not a matter of beating the receiver to the spot, but he excels at the cat and mouse game prior to the cut due to the economy of his footwork. As a marker, he\u0026rsquo;s never taking large steps and lunging at fakes that the thrower gives with his pivoting or throwing arm—both feet work together to keep balanced, and on high counts the strength of his D1 background is really exposed.\nAbout the time I came to Ring (summer of 2003) I started using a ten yard single agility ladder. Prior to that, I would polish my footwork with agility drills using cones and stairs, as well as skipping lots of rope. For footwork and to get the heart rate up, a favorite drill three times a week was to sling the rope for six rounds: skip for 3 minutes, pushups for 1 minute, for six rounds. A shorter speed rope always worked best and was more difficult.\nOutside of sparring, I\u0026rsquo;ve always been interested in the ways boxers train. My stepmother\u0026rsquo;s father would have boxed for Germany in the 1936 Olympic Games, but his parents were Polish Jews living in Berlin. Prior to finding track, my father boxed for Charlotte Central and was champ of his weight division his sophomore and junior years. UVA was considering offering him a scholarship but then NC banned boxing in their high schools, and the rest is history. I followed boxing religiously from somewhere around Leonard\u0026rsquo;s gold medal in the \u0026lsquo;76 Olympics to just after the Leonard/Hagler bout. You can see a touch of the sweet science in Ultimate, here and there, every now and again.\nUsing the ladder, I employed it two or three times a week after the meat of a workout or practice with probably 5 reps of 7 to 10 exercises. As the game became more cerebral, the commitment to footwork helped in the open field during stoppages: getting open going under or away off of a two step move that was simply muscle memory, as well as changing direction in the front of the stack when the count is getting high and the thrower\u0026rsquo;s options are running out.\nWhen the offense is being forced line, you\u0026rsquo;re the number one dump posted up 10 to 12 yards from the marker\u0026rsquo;s fanny. Stepping to the dump is really no problem, the pressure is on someone else, but then you\u0026rsquo;re going to be expected to \u0026ldquo;swing\u0026rdquo; the disc. Do you turn inside or outside? What if the pass floats? How do you recover? What if it\u0026rsquo;s a short footrace? Do you go two hands or one hand and how do you prepare your feet? Getting yardage up the line is a real trick. Proper footwork and good acting can get you breathing room up the line for the so-called Cut of Death. Again, it\u0026rsquo;s a one-two combination (on top of a handful of other things moving a thousand miles per second).\nExperience of course goes quite a long way, but I think many of these techniques can be taught and learned and perfected. Again, it\u0026rsquo;s all muscle memory, situation, repetition, and a commitment to hard work, or working hard for that matter.\nI\u0026rsquo;m surprised at how many players round the bases rather than slice up the field in sharp angles and take advantage of the cleats on their feet. Some players are fast and some have big long strides and can cover a lot of ground and some players have great closing speed inside fifteen yards. Yet proper and effective footwork, most players completely lack.\nA move I\u0026rsquo;ve always liked is the power cut-back pedal-power cut. That\u0026rsquo;s posting up in the back of the stack and lying low for a swing—pulling the defender out to the flats with a power cut, pull up and back pedal or drop step, and then change direction again and drive forward to the cone. Another, and I think this was discussed recently on (that black hole of goo called) RSD, is the move you make after a teammate has made the catch just outside the endzone, on the teeth of the goal line. A lot of players do the run by and put up their hand up expecting the old Nerf to be lobbed to them like it was recess. I like the run by, a drop step, and then going left or right or under with hands way out in front for a possible handoff pass. I\u0026rsquo;m amazed at how many times a player is the first there after the catch, does the run by and somehow feels the D has done his job. Shoot, you have to make that guy work or else that genius teammate of yours is going to waste a timeout.\n"

  "content": "I am a big fan of simple rules that can be followed that have far reaching implications for improving your individual game. Staying on your toes, or more appropriately, keeping your weight on the balls of your feet, is one of the best, and can be the foundation for all improvement in footwork that increase your basic skills set. My mentor in the game, Steve Joye, one of the best players of the 80\u0026rsquo;s and early 90\u0026rsquo;s was a big (almost manic) proponent on this. He would throw on his toes, cut on his toes, mark on his toes, argue calls while bouncing around on his toes, go for trail runs on his toes, walk around work on his toes—crazy. But also, he was crazy good at all aspects of the game.\nThe key is to \u0026ldquo;toestrike\u0026rdquo; whenever transferring weight/preparing for your next action/reaction—never, if you can help it, transfer weight to your heels. Staying on your toes at all times out on the field sets up a cascade of body mechanic compensations that put you in the universal \u0026ldquo;attack\u0026rdquo; position for explosive sports. You bend your knees slightly, you crouch some with arms bent in front of your body, and you balance over the balls of your feet—committed only to being ready for the next move needed to make the play.\nThrowing\nAfter receiving the disc, I immediately get my weight onto the balls of my feet to lower my weight. Then, whenever I pivot and throw, I always step out onto the balls of my feet—to the backhand and to the forehand, staying bent and balanced. This is part of my muscle memory now, but something I spent a lot of time focusing on early in my career—whenever I threw, I never casually stood lock-kneed or straight up, and never stepped out onto my heels\u0026hellip;always out and onto my toes. The benefits are numerous, but one of the best is that I never \u0026ldquo;turf\u0026rdquo; the disc—even as I tire.\nStarting from the lock-kneed position and/or heel striking on the pivot throws your core weight foreward and then down, becoming more pronounced as you get tired. This momentum will be transferred to the disc on quick pivot/throws. I have watched this with great interest over the years and noted that every Semifinal fatigue \u0026ldquo;turf burger\u0026rdquo; was preceeded by a heel strike—followed by a look of confusion//rustration on the throwers face who does not seem to know what happened. I mean, who the heck wants their turnovers to start inexplicably appearing late on Sunday?\nCutting//Defending\nNick Handler, my teammate on Revolver is one of the better current examples of the benefits of staying on your toes out in the passing lanes. His weekly workouts always include cone drills designed specifically to perfect footwork while staying on his toes, so this has been a learned/drilled skill. On offense, he will cut full speed, then pull this pause \u0026ldquo;float\u0026rdquo; move. Fun to watch. Really, he just takes a series of shorter \u0026ldquo;stutter\u0026rdquo; steps on his toes at speed, moving, crouching, preparing, then explodes from that position to any one of the 360 degrees he next deems best. On defense he uses this same great basic skill to great benefit: as his assigned lane cutter jukes/fakes/pauses, Nick pulls the \u0026ldquo;float\u0026rdquo; ready to react and close the gap when the cutter finally commits to his cut.\nIn any situation out there, practice getting to and staying on your toes. If you are not already there, like I like to say, that should be very next on your list of things to do.\n"

  "issue": "006",
  "content": "Two players that come to mind when I think of good footwork are Idris Nolan offensively and Hensley Sejour defensively. Idris is quite a good basketball player, which requires a significant amount of body control as well as footwork. Hensley, coming from a football background as a defensive back (I believe) has worked on his footwork extensively.\nWhether offensively or defensively, Idris and Hensley have the same traits in common:\n1. Awareness of the current situation.\nEach player understands where the disc is on the field. Knowing where the disc is on the field allows you to position yourself to make a play. They are also keenly aware of the type of player that is opposite of them and are able to identify their strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, they are aware of they player who has the disc.\n2. Positioning themselves.\nUsing the knowledge from assessing the situation, they position themselves to make a play. Offensively this could be repositioning yourself to a location that will make the next throw easier, or closing the distance between themselves and the defender. From a defensive standpoint, it could be as simple as taking an extra half step toward the disc, or a step to the break side.\n3. Making people commit.\nOffensively, Idris is great at making people commit one way and changing his direction. I think that comes quite a bit from playing basketball and trying to get people off balance. Defensively, Hensley will position himself so that the offensive player only has one cut. However, with the footwork of a defensive back, if he is feinted, he is able to recover quickly without tripping over himself.\nTheir awareness, positioning, and footwork to make people commit or recover allow them to make plays on offense and defense.\nOver the past two years, our teams have started to implement footwork drills during track sessions. Most of the footwork drills are ladder drills at this time. Our workouts in sprinting have incorporated some footwork drills, but usually the focus is on Ultimate specific type of sprints. Everyone on our team has noticed that their footwork in Ultimate is better from even doing something simple as ladder drills.\nI think the Ultimate community is very slowly coming to the realization that there is a proper way of doing things, but have yet to make the change. Mostly because there has not been an authority figure to say this is the right way to do something. For instance, we may do some defensive drills, but each player executes their footwork as they know how and are unwilling to change because they have been successful in the past even with poor footwork.\nThis will change in the future, as I see the implementation of soccer and defensive back football type drills into ultimate, as players start to make the association between the footwork in those two sports and Ultimate. This implementation will have to come from players who are/were low level college players who have practiced the footwork and know the drills that work to improve footwork. With few exceptions, we are not there quite yet\u0026hellip;but we will be shortly.\n"

  "content": "Is footwork important? Only if winning games is important. Ultimate, maybe more than any sport, has layers of pretty arm and upper-body movement that disguise a game primarily decided by feet. Basketball is right up there.\nAs a handler, I get lots of different body-types defending me during big games. I\u0026rsquo;m just as likely to look across the line and see Jit (Revolver\u0026rsquo;s tiny handler-defender extraordinaire) as I am to see some massive athlete that I have no hope of running with. Jam usually throws a defender at me like Big Jim Schoettler; in a race with this guy, of any distance, I would need him to be wearing flippers. The hardest defenders to beat in a small space, of any size, are those that are confident and fluid in their footwork.\nIf I can find a hole in a defender\u0026rsquo;s footwork, I can use that. Do they turn 180 degrees poorly? I\u0026rsquo;ll know within a cut or two. Some defenders love to go side-to-side from a stopped position\u0026hellip;fine, I\u0026rsquo;ll start my sideways cuts from a jog, and watch them struggle. Jit (and especially Mike Jaeger, who I am grateful I only have to play against in practice) is amazing at moving to any direction from any direction\u0026hellip;I have to make my best move, my best fake, and get a little lucky or be a little stronger on that particular day. Plus, if I do get the disc, he knows where he wants his feet in relation to mine for the mark, and I can\u0026rsquo;t coerce him to go somewhere else with any kind of fake.\nDefensively, Jaime Arambula (you might know him as Idaho) is revolutionizing what I think of defensive training. He is taking small moments out of D moves, and translating those into drills. I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing this with teams as well\u0026hellip;the Seattle YCC team in 2005 may have had a flaw or two, but those guys could flat out mark straight up. They would force throwers to make 1-2 extra pivots per stall count. If you don\u0026rsquo;t think that adds up, go count out how many pivots you make on an average touch, and then add 2 for a game. Fatigue, timing problems, confusion, loss of calm vision\u0026hellip;it adds up. We trained by doing short, focused drills on tiny parts of the mark. Idaho\u0026rsquo;s PLU women have had some of the best person-to-person D footwork I\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen for an entire college team in either gender.\nYou know that karaoke move that everyone does for 20 or so yards for warmups? The reason it makes you better is that it builds the little muscles that help make that move on the field. Not that you would ever run 20 yards in that stance\u0026hellip;but you often move 1/2 of a yard in that manner, in the transition from moving sideways to moving forward, say. Those transitions are where you can build or lose margins against an equally fast player. If you aren\u0026rsquo;t training for those, then you better be much faster than everyone you play against.\n"

  "issue": "005",
  "content": "In this situation, it seems that it would be best to prescribe some movement, team-wide, which will give the thrower some better options than \u0026ldquo;turn to the dump.\u0026rdquo; Expressing some coordinated movement where all players (or at least those around the disc) have certain responsibilities will help clear up confusion and provide purpose to people\u0026rsquo;s movement.\nOn a previous team I played for, we had very specific dump rotations, and we ran a specific rotation for the first half and then switched that movement at halftime. The movement typically involved at least 2 people around the disc and was designed to give the thrower two complementary, simple looks.\nIn the example, the upfield movement is good so you have to be careful of doing something which may interrupt that movement. To this end, it may be more beneficial to encourage the reset receivers to really focus on getting setup earlier. If the thrower feels the dump presence waiting, he will be more inclined to turn earlier, and give the receiver more time to work. Too frequently an incompleted dump pass is put on the thrower, but there are many things the receiver can do to make the thrower more comfortable: give more space to throw to, or position the defender in a bad place. Sometimes this is as simple as having dump cutters focus on getting into position earlier.\nI think these adjustments would be especially valuable for a begining team. A more experienced team would have a more organic process where the thrower and cutter are in tune with one another and have more freedom to ad-lib good movement. Specific rotations and direct instructions (\u0026ldquo;Get set up earlier,\u0026rdquo; or, \u0026ldquo;Give the thrower more space\u0026rdquo;) will help get an inexperienced team on the same page quicker.\n"

  "content": "A good offense should be able to reset against even a very good defense. If we\u0026rsquo;re having trouble resetting, chances are that we\u0026rsquo;re suffering from a problem of our own making: either A. The design of our reset protocol is flawed; or B. We\u0026rsquo;re executing it poorly. †\nA. There are many effective ways to reset a disc, but any effective way will probably have these elements:\nThe reset cutters give the thrower at least two options, simultaneously or in close succession, such that the marker must leave at least one throw open.\nThe resets begin their cuts early in the stall count (by stall 5—probably earlier), such that the thrower can pivot at least a couple of times, if need be, before throwing.\nThe reset cutters are positioned such that they are threatening two viable cutting spaces.\nThere is a \u0026ldquo;safety valve\u0026rdquo; cutter—often times a downfield cutter (rather than a handler)—who is looking to move towards unoccupied space (often an inside-out/breakmark passing lane) on a high stall.\nThe primary reset\u0026rsquo;s goal is not only to get ten more seconds, but also to win vertical and/or lateral yards.\nB. Several common execution problems:\nWhen reset cutters are covered, the thrower just watches them, instead of pivoting and faking to them (thereby moving the mark along with him).\nWell-guarded reset cutters \u0026ldquo;dance\u0026rdquo; in the lane, thinking that the team is depending on them to get the disc. In reality, they are taking up space that a secondary reset or \u0026ldquo;safety valve\u0026rdquo; cutter might otherwise use to get open.\nThe reset cutters haven\u0026rsquo;t sprinted into position or aren\u0026rsquo;t in ideal position to start a cut when the thrower needs it.\nThe reset cutters are taking nonaggressive angles, failing to get their bodies between the defender and the space the disc will be thrown to.\nN.B. All of these execution problems are also likely symptoms of player fatigue and/or inadequate physical conditioning.\nIn our hypothetical elimination game, we need to ask what the single biggest reason is that they\u0026rsquo;re able to defend our resets well. (\u0026ldquo;Single biggest,\u0026rdquo; I say, because not even the most coachable player can implement more than one big change at once). Are our handlers too fatigued to get into position early? Maybe then we should seek opportunities to rest them; or we can assign someone on each sideline to talk to them throughout each point to remind them to get into position; or if they\u0026rsquo;re defensive handlers, we make sure they\u0026rsquo;re matched up on easier opponents.\nWhatever the solution, if it\u0026rsquo;s an in-game adjustment, it has to address the weakness that they\u0026rsquo;re most taking advantage of, and we have to choose only one thing to address.\n† There is a third possibility, which is that we\u0026rsquo;re executing a very good strategy pretty darn well, but the defense has tailored a specific strategy to us, which is causing our miscues. The hypotheticals here get a little bit too confusing to go into much detail. As a general principle, though, I\u0026rsquo;ll say that we need to adjust our strategy, and our adjustment, since it\u0026rsquo;s in-game, needs to be significant yet very very simple.\n"

  "title": "Anticipating The Throw",
  "author": "Nancy Sun",
  "issue": "005",
  "content": "One of the attributes of teams that do well at Nationals and other high-level tournaments is their handler defense. Many teams can do a pretty good job at containing handlers (e.g. getting the mark on to stop upfield break throws, adjusting to stop give-go\u0026rsquo;s, preventing up-the-line cuts). However, I think there are only a few teams that have the personnel and strategy to consistently pressure and generate D\u0026rsquo;s on handler resets—this includes pressure on both the thrower who may or may not be a handler, and on the actual handler who makes the reset.\nI think that knowing which of these buckets your opponent falls into is important to include in any pre-game scouting report. Especially if your team is coming off of a game where handler resets were easy, it is easy for offenses to get too comfortable, so knowing beforehand allows the team to do some pre-game prep. Some useful drills to do are ones that emphasize decisive handler motion and on throwing against tough marks.\nFrom a team strategy perspective, there are a few adjustments I would make once the game gets going and it is clear that reset cuts are getting heavy pressure. The first is to calmly acknowledge that it is a little more difficult to complete reset passes, and that we can make it much easier for ourselves if we focus on three things:\n1. As a thrower, look a little bit earlier. Give yourself more time so that things are less rushed.\n2. Assuming that as a team you are already used to doing this, remind the thrower to fake and pivot. This makes the offense less easy to predict.\n3. If you are responsible for making the reset cut, focus on anticipating the throw coming. It may have been easy in the last game to just wait until the thrower looked at you before moving, but now you have to take more initiative. Take a look upfield to see what the thrower sees and check in with your internal stall count. You know your teammates, so keep an eye out for signs that they are about to turn to you. That tenth of a second you gain by anticipating will go a long way.\nFrom a individual perspective, one of the things I really like to think about as a handler against teams with tough handler defense is \u0026ldquo;winning with your legs, not your throws\u0026rdquo;. This reminds me to focus on being aggressive with my legs to drive my defender so that I can put myself in good positions to make easy throws.\n"

  "issue": "005",
  "content": "Three thoughts.\nFirst, this is just the way high pressure games are. As the stakes increase, the defense ratchets up and the offense needs to ratchet up accordingly. How do you do this? Be mentally strong. The best path to this kind of mental fortitude is playing in and winning these games. The second best path (and the one reserved for those not on championship teams) is practicing all out. You play how you practice, so if you challenge yourself and your teammates every practice, you gameday performance will be correspondingly superior.\nThe first technical adjustment is to change rhythm. Are you a dump-on-6 team? Start throwing some of your resets on 1, 2, 3 in the stall count. Good defensive teams and players run a clock in their heads. If your team is predictable about when it throws its resets, you are effectively telling the defenders when you are gong to cut. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to throw but a few off- rhythm passes to get an edge on the defense. Throw a couple swings on stalling 2 and then your fake on stalling 2 gets the defender biting and guessing.\nThe second adjustment is to bring your bigs into the handler set on stalling 7 or 8 for an emergency reset. Instead of throwing to a dancing and scrambling handler, have your bigs continue their cuts down into the hole for a two or three yard flip to reset the stall count. Then the big hits the handler with the swing on stalling 1 or 2 (see above). Both Sockeye (CK and MC) and Furious (Lugs and MG) use this technique consistently and effectively.\n"

  "content": "I believe that good chemistry between handlers can affect the game more than at any other position. Having two or three experienced handlers that really know each other is such an advantage because they likely have withstood defensive pressure like this before and they likely have talked about it and figured out, between them, how to deal with it. Because they can predict what the other is going to do, they don\u0026rsquo;t panic when the stall count gets higher and they can reset the disc accordingly.\nThe next best thing to good chemistry is having a dump system and running it continuously at practice. Drilling over and over at practice simulates chemistry by making cuts and throws predictable. When the pressure mounts and novel situations present themselves, like the unusually stifling defense here, handlers can rely on the cuts they know are coming. It sounds so simple, but on the fields it\u0026rsquo;s a very difficult thing to do.\nIn my experience, when handlers run into trouble moving the disc it is because the dump system and chemistry induce different results. The system might tell you \u0026ldquo;cut upfield\u0026rdquo; whereas chemistry tells you \u0026ldquo;cut downfield.\u0026rdquo; It seems like the turnover that happened in this situation resulted from this type of miscommunication. Since that is the only turnover between the handlers so far I would pull them aside to make sure they get back on the same page. Handlers deserve a lot of discretion to decide how to make adjustments to particular situations like this one. They often see important things that other players don\u0026rsquo;t and should be free to take advantage of what they see. However, its important to keep a close eye on them, as system-wide or personnel adjustments may be necessary.\nAt the college level, where a couple of main handlers will play a large portion of the points, you have to consider fatigue from playing against such tight defense when deciding whether to make a halftime adjustment. You will need these handlers to play well at the end of games. To keep them from getting gassed, adjustments can be made to the dump system to minimize cutting. For example, the dump could focus on finding a good position early in the stall count so when the thrower turns to dump he is already in position. Then the dump can stand still and let the thrower initiate his cut by throwing the disc to space to one side. This way the handler-dump only has to make one cut to get the reset.\n"

  "content": "My first impression of this situation would be to not over-react. There have been close calls, and one turn on handler cuts. If you are getting close to, or are already at the half, this is a pretty good tally to have, and I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t make major changes.\nSome small things to consider:\nIf the other team is counting the stall quickly (most likely the case), the thrower should make the fast-count call as he turns to the dump, or earlier.\nA typical adjustment would be for the throwers to look to the dumps earlier. However, since the downfield flow is \u0026ldquo;good,\u0026rdquo; if you start trying to get a short reset at 5 instead of 6, you\u0026rsquo;ll end up throwing more throws per point, as dumps will be thrown instead of downfield cuts that show up from stall 5 to 6. Typically, more throws is not a good thing, and may or may not be balanced by an increased completion percentage.\nIf you have some other offensive set, give it a try for a point or two to keep the defense from continuing to zero in on your primary set.\nIf this sequence of events has happened in the first few points of the game, and it has entered the team\u0026rsquo;s psyche, then you should start thinking about making major changes:\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t have an alternative offensive set, think about getting a couple players who work well together to run a dominator or trimanator for a set number of throws or to a call where you enter your normal offensive set.\nIf the defense is overplaying one or more aspects of your scheme, change the position/timing so your players will have another option. For example, if a team is camping on the inside-out break to the front of the stack, have that cutter fake to the break side, and then go back to the open side.\nEmphasize looking for and hitting the first open receiver, even if it is outside of your offensive set. The overall goal being to keep the disc moving, and prevent the defense from settling into whatever set the have worked out.\n"

  "content": "The best way to attack a team that is playing good shut-down defense is to keep the disc moving, and moving quickly. This is not a novel concept by any means, but it\u0026rsquo;s rare that a team actually hits the first open pass consistently. Throwers tend to get antsy if you\u0026rsquo;re not gaining yardage and instead of looking to get rid of the frisbee, will instead hold it looking for something upfiled. Every defense loves to play against a team that holds the disc. It allows the mark to be more aggressive, and lets the downfield defenders lock down on their men (because they know where the disc will be coming from when a throw goes up).\nSo the basic strategy is to hit the first open pass you see. If you\u0026rsquo;re not used to playing this way it can be quite an adjustment\u0026amp;you\u0026rsquo;re not looking for the ideal pass, but you\u0026rsquo;re making the first high percentage pass no matter where it is. It may seem like you\u0026rsquo;re moving the disc just for the sake of moving it, and you\u0026rsquo;re really not getting anywhere. In fact, that may well be the case for the first number of passes of a point. The key is to generate movement from the handlers and cutters, and to bounce the disc around as quickly as possible without being frantic. Throw and go. If there\u0026rsquo;s not an obvious open cut when you receive a pass, pitch it right back to the thrower and cut again.\nMoving the disc starts with the handlers—they need to get the ball rolling, and the downfield cutters fill in the gaps when they see a swing pass go up, or when a handler gets an up-line pass.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s all about movement—with the disc and with cuts. Don\u0026rsquo;t hold the disc as a thrower, and don\u0026rsquo;t stand around as a handler. The one caution is to make sure you don\u0026rsquo;t rush your throws\u0026amp;catch the disc, find the open man, make a good throw, then get going again. The last thing you want to do is turf a 5 yard pass because you rushed it, or drop an easy pass because you were focused on the next pass instead of making sure of the catch.\n"

  "issue": "005",
  "content": "When this happens I need to assess what about our reset isn\u0026rsquo;t working before I change anything. Generally, there are a few problems that are typical of this sort of situation.\nThe dump is not working hard enough. This is actually not the most likely explanation, but it does happen. This typically results from lack of readiness—the dump fails to get to position in a timely matter, or relies on the thrower to thread the needle rather than actually getting open. Handlers can become lazy getting to the dump position, so I would encourage handlers to throw and go, whether that go is a cut or just getting to the dump position. This always makes life more difficult for defenders and allows the offense to set the tone. If anyone is confused about this, watch Gwen Ambler move after she throws and you\u0026rsquo;ll see what I am talking about.\nThe dump is working too hard. This is quite common and something I see very often in the college and elite women\u0026rsquo;s game. The dump will either start cutting before the thrower is ready, be indecisive in their cuts, or stick with a bad cut too long before clearing. These all result in movement I like to call \u0026ldquo;dancing,\u0026rdquo; and on the ultimate field dancing is bad. A dump needs to be patient (wait for the thrower to signal readiness with vocal or body communication), decisive (make 0-2 jukes and a strong cut), and realistic (if they aren\u0026rsquo;t open get the heck out—we typically have the front of the stack ready as a bailout dump option if the first dump is not available). Dancing often results from tenacious face-guarding defense, which can be dismantled better by the dump standing stationary and the thrower, unbeknownst to the defender, putting the disc into space, rather than the extra movement on the dump\u0026rsquo;s part. It is important for the dump to just chill out and not get frustrated.\nThe thrower is being tentative. I see this quite often and I spend a good deal of time working with my college and youth teams on this skill. People always say that if you can throw a dump, you\u0026rsquo;re good to go. But this is a little harder than it sounds. New players are particularly prone to intimidation by an active and physical mark. To combat this, at any level, a thrower needs to communicate with their dump—say her name and turn your entire body toward her, step toward where you want to deliver the pass and, as Michael Baccarini taught us, deal the cards (snap your wrist to get snap on a short throw).\nI think that most reset problems stem from one of these three scenarios, as well as the problem of dumps being stagnant and being unwilling to go upfield. But to me, you have two equally good options as a dump—either up-the-line or back—and you better be able to take advantage of both, particularly against aggressive defenders.\n"

  "content": "It seems sensible to find the disc as early as possible. However, I think first I need to make sure I\u0026rsquo;m matching the receiver stride for stride, so I let them do the work of finding the disc early on and use that time to make up some ground.\nAny work they do finding the disc will also help me pinpoint where to look for it. Once I\u0026rsquo;m matching their stride, I\u0026rsquo;ll look for the disc and start making judgments about how the contest is going to pan out\nIf it\u0026rsquo;s a leading pass, I just need to put my head down and try to get between the receiver and the disc, as close to the receiver as possible, and preferably with a decent jump. If I can establish a better line than them, I\u0026rsquo;ll try to do that. Realistically, my high layouts are pretty ineffectual and injury-creating, but I\u0026rsquo;ve seen some great high blocks from layouts, so go for it if it\u0026rsquo;s your thing.\nIf it\u0026rsquo;s a floating pass, I would usually approach the bid from behind the receiver. If the receiver needs to back up, I probably try to establish position early to stop them backing up (but beware other receivers coming in for scraps!). If the receiver has good position, I try to stay out and get in a well-timed maximal jump at speed while they\u0026rsquo;re standing flat-footed under the disc. If the cut is from the break side, it generally means there\u0026rsquo;s a bit more room for negotiating position, so it pays to find the disc early and establish the best line at the disc.\nIf they have a height advantage, I\u0026rsquo;ll try to establish position early and stop them getting a play on the disc. If I have a height advantage, I\u0026rsquo;ll try to just find the place where I can bid for it at close to maximum jump and bid for it there, assuming they can\u0026rsquo;t bid in the same place. But I want to minimise the risk of it going over my head and giving them a cheap win, so I include a bit of a margin of error in choosing that spot. So it helps to know if someone is short with big hops.\nIf it\u0026rsquo;s a leading pass and they have a speed advantage, as they spike it in my face I probably turn around and start abusing the marker for letting out a clean huck.\n"

  "content": "Deep D is a lot like poker in three significant ways:\n1. Information is more important than anything else.\n2. You play the hand you are dealt, and try to win more than your share given the cards in your hand.\n3. It ain\u0026rsquo;t over until til it\u0026rsquo;s over.\nInformation: As I turn to head deep and hear that \u0026ldquo;up\u0026rdquo; call, I need to get a read on the disc as quickly as possible. I definitely take a look, even if it loses me a small bit of speed. Personally, if that throw is a footrace, then I am likely to lose anyway\u0026hellip;especially if they have a step or two on me. Then again, if every throw was perfectly out in front, then it would be like playing 1-card draw; you win or lose based on your raw speed everytime. And I got dealt a 3 of diamonds a long time ago. But throws aren\u0026rsquo;t reliable or consistent, and there are lots of other ways to win. If I can make a quicker read than my opponent, I can win many of the discs that are too short (since I turn on them quicker if I recognize it early) and I have a better chance at discs that are turned in the win (where recognizing spin and speed can help me to pin the other player and use the win to take it away from both of us). I need that information as soon as I can.\nReading the disc is surprisingly accurate, even in a short amount of time. With a glance, I feel like I can pretty safely put my head down and run to a good spot. At U of Oregon, we used to play a game where we would huck the disc into the air, then close our eyes and run to a spot after watching for the first half-second. We did the same thing for shorter throws indoors\u0026hellip;with no wind, you can catch 2-3 out of 10 20-yard throws with your eyes closed, if you can read it for the first 3 feet of the flight. Getting the right early read is something you can practice.\nAdditionally, if the \u0026ldquo;up\u0026rdquo; call was wrong or if the disc is partially blocked then I can react more quickly if I see it first.\nThe Hand You Are Dealt: Once I see the disc in the air, I have a good idea of how likely it is that I should win.\nIf it is a smaller, slower player and I have a good chance of catching up to a hanging throw, then I should be able to make the play. I\u0026rsquo;m more likely to try for a catch-block, more conscious of preventing a foul by keeping clear, and more likely to wait to go so that I don\u0026rsquo;t give up an easy catch by misreading.\nThe better athlete that I am against, or the worse the throw/position situation\u0026hellip;the more likely that I am going to want to bid early or try to win by position. I can take some risks, or make a read on the disc based on what it might do. For example, if the disc is coming in with some wind, and I think that there is a 1/5 chance that it might hang for longer\u0026hellip;I might try to pin the other player so that I win those 20% of discs IF I think they are likely to beat me more than 80% of the time if I make a normal play. Occassionally, this leads to what seems like a very poor read, and a good athlete makes an easy catch. Even flat-footed. I get posterized sometimes. Losing and looking bad, to me, is no different from losing and giving a handsome, respectable effort. But occassionally I will get a block against someone I have no business blocking, by playing against those odds.\nAn aside\u0026hellip;my horror situation: Getting an awesome read and position against a much better athlete. Not that this is a terribly situation, numbers-wise (I just hate having the other player own control of the outcome). At Nationals in 2004, I made the break of my life to a disc in the corner while guarding Bailey Russell (Pike). I went up with a good read and tried to stay wide in the shoulders to keep him away. It felt like a sure block, until he jumped fully around me the wrong way to come down with a goal. He made it look easy, and made me look silly.\nThe scariest second of my life was poaching onto a huck in the semis in 2007 and knowing that, somewhere, Damien was behind me and coming as his top speed (with the understanding that his \u0026lsquo;slow\u0026rsquo; is faster than my \u0026lsquo;fast\u0026rsquo;). As I went up, I had absolutely no clue whether or not this was going to be Bailey all over again. Luckily, I stuck to my read and, as it happens, Damien is about 14 yards faster than me on a 40 yard sprint\u0026hellip;but he isn\u0026rsquo;t 15 yards faster. This is my version of a huge bluff, when the other player has the ability to call or fold; your life is in their hands.\nIt Ain\u0026rsquo;t Over \u0026lsquo;Til It\u0026rsquo;s Over: Play the thing out. You never know when a great athlete is going to bobble the disc, and your hustle might put you in position to knock it away. Catch every block you can (how many times have you ever tried to catch a block, and had it MAC up and get caught? Now, how many times have you had this happen when you swiped at it? The math comes out huge on the side of the catch-block attempt). If you jump, and miss, try to land ready to jump again. They might have missed as well, and it might be the second jump that gets you there. Just because you have the best hand, you don\u0026rsquo;t start grinning and throwing chips at the pile\u0026hellip;do the work. You may have the worst possible hand, but don\u0026rsquo;t go out unless you are forced to pay to keep going. You never know which hand you might win.\n"

  "content": "As I am already behind, my priority is to catch up. It\u0026rsquo;s harder to run fast with your head turned, so I will sometimes let the intended receiver read the disc for me and take the hit, in terms of speed. At this point, help from the sideline, in terms of which direction to go, is very helpful.\nAs soon as I know that I can catch up, or I hear from the sideline that the throw is short, I will turn my head. If I turn my head and am close to the offensive player, I will also raise my off arm (head turned right means left arm is up) about chest level with my forearm bent and parallel with the ground. This arm is especially important with floaty discs, but is not used with any significant force. It is more of a warning system to prevent tangled legs or knocked heads, which is easy when there are two people not looking where they are going.\nAll thing being equal, I will work to get between the path the disc will take to the receiver. I only have to get a tip of a finger to get a block, but they need a whole hand, which means I can make a more aggressive bid. Making a defensive bid from the backside can be dangerous, and rarely results in a clean block. Taking a position behind the receiver relative to the path of the disc should be reserved for gross misreads by the receiver.\nAs the disc makes its final approach, I focus on making an aggressive bid. This means coordinating my movements so that when the time comes to jump or layout, I am ready to do so. This means chopping my steps to take off on the correct foot (if there is time to do so), and driving my arms (like a high- jumper).\n"

  "content": "When I hear the \u0026ldquo;up\u0026rdquo; call I try to spot the disc, briefly and without giving up any more ground.\nI need to ascertain if it has truly gone up, and if it is intended for the player I am now chasing. If both of these things are true, then I try to make some quick calculations based on what type of throw has been made.\nIf it is low or short, I can simply go to it and have position underneath.\nIf it is high, I need to catch up and try to establish a good position to jump at it. Ideally, it is a position where the player I am defending can\u0026rsquo;t get a running leap at the disc, or a position where the player I am defending has to foul me to make a play.\nIf the throw is long, I have to assess if I can make up the ground, to establish the position I just described, or try and sell my angle as to draw the player I am defending off his line, or now to defend me. (This could also be a strategy for high throws).\nAlso, as I am running through this situation I am aware, or try to be, of where any help could be coming from. Likely: nowhere, since we were in the back of the stack. However, if my player\u0026rsquo;s in cut was \u0026ldquo;in\u0026rdquo; enough, I will have some support deep.\nI think you have a better chance to make the play or have them miss it if they are less athletic. If they are more athletic, I would probably force more under and try to block the away cut. I don\u0026rsquo;t think the force matters too much, except where you might look as the \u0026ldquo;up\u0026rdquo; call happens as it will limit the some throwers options.\n"

  "content": "There is a big factor that comes into play here that I should use to set the stage:\nWhy are big time football receivers 6'2\u0026quot; or 6'3\u0026quot; and 220lbs (think Terrell Owens), while big time defensive backs are 5'10\u0026quot; or 5'11\u0026quot; and 190lbs?\nAnd: Why does it generally seem that DBs are the fastest guys, but you routinely see them getting beat deep by receivers who should be slower?\nThere are two speeds that ultimate defenders (and football defenders) have. The first is the sprint where your man may change directions, and the second is the sprint where you\u0026rsquo;re going for the disc and can just go all out. Against many receivers the former is all you need, but at the elite levels you have to have the latter, and you have to be able to use it wisely. If you can stay in the ballpark with your \u0026ldquo;change direction\u0026rdquo; sprint then you\u0026rsquo;ve got some big challenges ahead of you. Try getting into an all-out sprint and have your man change direction and you\u0026rsquo;re going to be hosed because your form is not prepared to make this change and you\u0026rsquo;ll spend an extra few steps changing your vector. Receivers have the luxury of being able to be in that full sprint mode whenever they want because they know when they have to change direction and can subtly alter their form to make those changes. Defenders have to constantly be ready for the receiver to change direction.\nAs soon as I hear that \u0026ldquo;up\u0026rdquo; call, I try getting into the all-out sprint mode. As I\u0026rsquo;m doing that, and maybe even more importantly, I take a quick look back to see if I can get a glimpse of the disc. This quick look can give you a lot of information: what shoulder is the disc going to, is it a missile or a floater and is it flat or hooking? With this information in mind, I\u0026rsquo;ll then try to close the gap, hopefully getting on the receiver\u0026rsquo;s shoulder on the side I think the disc is coming to.\nIf I\u0026rsquo;ve got a bigger gap to close I might listen for a shoulder from the sideline, or try to take cues from the receiver to get some of the information the look back would have helped with. If I see the receiver really start striding I know it\u0026rsquo;s going to be long and I\u0026rsquo;ve got to close and get by him to have a chance. If I see him sit up I can guess it\u0026rsquo;s going to be a floater and I\u0026rsquo;ll have time to get there and should be ready to jump. I can also figure out which shoulder by seeing how he looks back.\nIn the last few steps I start assessing the situation: where is the disc coming down, where can I take it earliest, where is the receiver? The goal is to take it as early as possible while not giving a bailout foul. If he\u0026rsquo;s misread it, I may have a little leeway in where I can take it down or how to position myself to prevent him from making a play.\nThe athleticism of the opponent plays less of a role than one might think (for me at least). The first thing is to figure out where I can take the disc as early as possible. I\u0026rsquo;ll generally assume that my opponent will have similar athleticism, so if I take it at my highest he should be looking to take it at a similar spot. But if I can get there at the same time or a bit earlier I\u0026rsquo;ll be fine. If he\u0026rsquo;s got position or can get it sooner than me, then I might have to change my bid to try to take him out of his comfort zone and hope for the best, assuming that my normal bid would be worthless.\n"

  "issue": "004",
  "content": "Even though the answer to this question is pretty straightforward—a surprising number of club players make errors on this play.\nFirst of all, if I am only a stride or two behind my check when a huck goes up then I am feeling pretty good about my positioning. Only a perfectly thrown disc will not allow me to have a play on it. Secondly—and this is where many players make an error—I always make the inside play on the disc. No matter your height or the height of your opponent, it is always more difficult for someone to jump over you to make a catch. On occasion, when I am boxed out and lose the battle for position, I am invariably caught getting a close up view of a sweaty butt in my face as my check catches the disc uncontested.\nAt the elite levels, positioning is everything. Get in front. You may need to push and battle for this positioning. If your opponent is way taller than you and the disc is too high for you to touch, jump early and try to get them to go up early too. If your opponent is only an inch or two taller than you (or shorter) then go for the disc at your max. If you are in front and have position, your jump should be plenty to make the play.\nWhatever you do\u0026hellip;don\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;snuggle\u0026rdquo; in behind. That is just bad ultimate.\n"

  "content": "Being a receiver, this scenario is one of my favorite moments in ultimate. The adrenaline kicks in and it dawns on you that it\u0026rsquo;s your turn to make the play you have been training all season. My training regimen is focused on maximizing acceleration and jumping ability, both of which are essential to getting the block in this scenario. But before putting those skills to use, you have to look up quickly and find the disc. In this brief glance you must do three things:\n1. Confirm that the throw is, in fact, to your man.\n2. Check to see if the disc is under-thrown.\n3. Identify if the throw is forehand or backhand—this will tell you which of your shoulders the disc will come over as well as the spin on the disc. All this information has to be ascertained instantly.\nThe next step, and I really don\u0026rsquo;t think the importance of this can be understated, is to get position on the other player. Unless you are a giant or have a 45\u0026quot; vertical, an advantageous position relative to the other player is the single best thing you can do to get the block.\nWhen I first started playing club ultimate, I was fortunate enough to play with Kevin Kusy on a successful Mixed team called BRU. Kusy is a great receiver who won a college championship with the 1999 NC State team. He was a bit bigger, a bit taller, and much more experienced than I was but we went up against each other all the time in practice. At first he absolutely tooled me on these types of plays. After a while I learned that getting position on him was more important than reading the disc perfectly and attempting to catch it at the height of my jump. Eventually, I started bringing down some discs against him by first establishing position.\nI learned that the first step in getting position is to get ahead of the other player as soon as possible. This is where the acceleration comes in. If you can beat the player downfield you can have first choice of position and that is hugely important. Additionally, once in front, you can dictate where the other player goes or does not go. You can steer him or her away from where you can make a play on the disc (within the scope of the rules, of course). If required, this is where the jumping ability comes in.\nAssuming I have position, as the disc is approaching I am thinking about how to make the play while keeping the other player \u0026ldquo;locked up,\u0026rdquo; usually on my shoulder. For example, if it\u0026rsquo;s a flick huck down the sideline, I would take a line on the disc that pushed the other player towards the middle of the field (again, obviously, within the scope of the rules). As the disc approached, I would adjust my speed to his in order to keep him locked up on my left shoulder so he couldn\u0026rsquo;t get around me to make a play. My last two steps would be strong towards the disc to make the block with an outstretched right arm.\nA ending tangent on acceptable levels of contact in receiving situations: I think that the undeniable increase in contact that goes uncalled in these situations at the elite level is due to the mutual respect players have for one another. It comes from a mutual desire to play as hard as possible and to leave everything on the field. Additionally it takes a mutual understanding that playing at that level necessarily requires a certain amount of contact that the rules, under some interpretations, may not allow. Oftentimes at the elite level, players chose to interpret the rules in a way that allows almost any receiving contact that does not truly affect the outcome of the play. In an extreme example, Kevin Kusy was playing with Ring of Fire in the semifinals of Club Nationals in 2003 against Furious George. A throw went up to his man, Andrew Lugsdin, in the endzone. Both players charged hard toward the disc and made so much contact that Kusy broke his clavicle on the play. Lugsdin caught the goal and no foul was called.\nI understand that this may seem unnecessarily dangerous to some. But I find it extremely satisfying to be able to battle with an opponent and take some hits knowing that I can hit right back without fearing a foul call. One of my favorite players to play against is Taylor Pope of Ring of Fire. When he guards me its always very physical. But the physical contact between us is never intended to gain an unfair advantage (e.g. tugging at shirts, intentional hacking on the mark, pushing, tripping). We both thrive on the challenge that physical play presents, but we also both understand where to draw the line. As such, I have a huge amount of respect for him. I suspect it is this combination of a mutual desire to play as hard as possible and a mutual respect for other players, that accounts for the level of acceptable contact at the elite level.\n"

  "content": "In the deep-D scenario, the disc is already in the air. But let\u0026rsquo;s rewind just a bit. As a defender, my goal is for the \u0026ldquo;up\u0026rdquo; call to be the second sign that the disc is coming. The first sign should be my anticipation of the play as it develops. The more I am aware of what is happening with the disc, the mark, and the other cutters, the easier it is to anticipate. As my man cuts on the field, I want to see the possible throws before they happen. Most of the throws I see will never go up, but when one does go up, I\u0026rsquo;m already on it.\nHave you ever sat a stoplight and watched the light for the other direction turn from green to yellow to red? When your light finally turns green, it\u0026rsquo;s just a confirmation of what you already knew was about to happen. How much quicker are you off that line if you\u0026rsquo;re peeking at the other light versus waiting for yours to change? That\u0026rsquo;s the difference between reacting and anticipating on D. When I hear that \u0026ldquo;up\u0026rdquo; call, I want to already know what throw is coming and already be poised to jump on it.\nOnce I hear that \u0026ldquo;up\u0026rdquo; call, my first action is to explode with three or four hard steps toward the cutter. I need to accelerate and start closing that gap between him and me. Especially if we\u0026rsquo;re similar in speed, every step counts. I\u0026rsquo;ve got to get there in order to make the play.\nNext, I take a quick look at the disc. Ideally, I\u0026rsquo;ve anticipated the throw that\u0026rsquo;s coming, and I know about where to look. The quick peek gives me a general read on the disc, usually falling into one of three categories: 1. too low or too short, and I\u0026rsquo;m going to pick it off easily; 2. long and cruisy, and it\u0026rsquo;s going to be a straight-up footrace; 3. something in between that will demand a good read on the disc and good positioning for the D.\nNow, I can adjust based on the my quick read of the disc. If the disc is short, I\u0026rsquo;ve found out soon enough to grab it before my man can cut back in. If the disc is long, I\u0026rsquo;m going to make like it\u0026rsquo;s track practice and blow by him. If it\u0026rsquo;s in between, as most throws tend to be, it gets more complicated.\nMy goal on a disc that\u0026rsquo;s hanging is to get myself right next to the cutter as quickly as possible. On D, I don\u0026rsquo;t want to read the disc and drift toward it, because I\u0026rsquo;m playing defense on the cutter, not the disc. Even if I don\u0026rsquo;t have a perfect read, if I\u0026rsquo;m next to my man I\u0026rsquo;ll be in position to make a play.\nEveryone loves the vertical game in ultimate, but most hanging discs are won and lost in the positioning more than the jump. I know that if I get myself in the right place, I\u0026rsquo;ll probably get the block Most cutters will read and drift toward the disc, and so want to keep off their back hip and away from where the disc is heading. If we\u0026rsquo;re running deep for an open-side forehand huck, the cutter wants to keep me off his right hip and catch with his left hand. The best way for me to get the block is to run past the cutter so I can take position right where he doesn\u0026rsquo;t want me to be. Suddenly, it\u0026rsquo;s a whole lot harder for him to read the disc, position himself to make the catch, and box me out all at the same time.\nAs I\u0026rsquo;m catching up to the cutter, I look back for a second read on the disc in order to decide whether to run past his front side or back side. If the throw is fairly straight, I like to run by the front side (the side closest to the throw) because it\u0026rsquo;s harder for the cutter to adjust and box me out. If the throw is tipping to the left (outside-in) and/or there\u0026rsquo;s wind pushing it that way, it\u0026rsquo;s generally best to run by the back side, putting myself right between the cutter and where he needs to go to make the catch. Whichever side I choose, I want to make sure I am at least even and probably a half step past the cutter.\nAs the disc comes in and I\u0026rsquo;m getting ready to go up, I want to stay close to the cutter. If we both miss it, it\u0026rsquo;s my disc. Once I take up position on the front side, I\u0026rsquo;m reading the cutter as much as the disc; I want to drift back with him so that if the disc jumps over me, it\u0026rsquo;s over him too. Once I take up position on the backside, I want to hold my ground so he can\u0026rsquo;t drift back and get under the disc.\nAt the right moment, I go up and grab it. Often, good positioning makes this easy. Sometimes, depending on the cutter and the situation, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t. But going for the catch is almost always the best play. First, I avoid tipping the disc to the cutter or another opponent following the play; losing a sweet D to the trash pick-up is more than dissappointing. Second, if it\u0026rsquo;s close, I\u0026rsquo;m more likely to make a fair, clean play on the disc, as opposed to if I\u0026rsquo;m chopping away at it. Third, if there\u0026rsquo;s some contact between players, especially incidental arm contact, it\u0026rsquo;s a lot harder to justify a foul call when I come down with the disc.\nFourth, the fast break is on.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s my deep D. To recap:\n0. Always peek at the light.\n1. Sprint first.\n2. Quick read.\n3. Get close.\n4. Run by.\n5. Stay close.\n6. Catch it.\n"

  "content": "When I hear the up-call, my first instinct is to get between my player and where I think the disc is going to be. I don\u0026rsquo;t look for the disc yet because the disc is secondary to my player when I\u0026rsquo;m on defense. If I can get my body into the proper position, I will get the disc every time.\nTypically in this situation, I will try to make some kind of body contact (not with arms or legs)—jockeying for position using my butt or shoulders to maintain my position between my player and the disc. This is something that changes from game to game in what will be called a foul and what will not. I appreciate games in which some contact is allowed so that contact similar to what is usually used in soccer for shielding the ball is appropriate.\nInformation that is important to me when trying to establish my position includes: type of throw (forehand vs. backhand, inside-out vs. outside-in), handedness of the thrower, power of throw, float of throw, and wind. All of these things will affect the flight pattern of the throw and thus where you should position yourself. You should know some of these things immediately—if the throw is on the live side, you know it is a forehand if you are forcing forehand. The one hitch to this is if the thrower is left-handed. To be a great defender, you need to check in with who has the disc at all times so that you know whether a forehand or lefty backhand will be coming up. You should always have the force of the wind noted in your mind at all times during a game so that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to lick your finger and test it while trying to get a D. The power, flight path (IO vs. OI), and float of the throw are all things you should be able to read by the first time you see the disc in the air.\nAfter hearing an up call, I typically take 3-4 hard sprint steps to catch up to my person before I check in with the disc. Then, when I do check in with the disc, it is a brief look during which I can see how high it is, how fast it is going and at what angle it is flying. The person I\u0026rsquo;m guarding doesn\u0026rsquo;t come into my mind that much as I try to establish position.\nIf you have all the correct information and have the right body positioning based on this information, you will be able to get the D every time. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about jumping higher than someone unless they are significantly more athletic or taller than you. If this is the case you might want to jump earlier to get more of your body between them and the disc (and they will also probably going early). If I am similarly athletic to my offensive player and in proper position, I will go for the catch with both hands to make sure I get the D. However, if I haven\u0026rsquo;t had time to get in the right position, I will go with one hand over or through the hands of my player to reduce the risk of fouling. If the huck goes up to the break side, I spend more time sprinting to get position and reading my player than I spend reading the disc itself because as the saying goes on defense, \u0026ldquo;Play the player, not the disc.\u0026rdquo; As long as they don\u0026rsquo;t catch it, you did your job.\n"

  "content": "More than any other skill in ultimate—besides, maybe, getting layout blocks—dominating in the air has largely to do with raw athleticism, aggressiveness, and instinct. There\u0026rsquo;s really no substitute for being a physical beast. If you\u0026rsquo;re tall and fast, and you have springs for legs, you\u0026rsquo;re going to posterize some poor souls, and in the process you\u0026rsquo;ll develop confidence and intuition that you\u0026rsquo;ll bring into every future matchup.\nSo: train. Even if you\u0026rsquo;re not a premium genetic specimen, effective training can bring out the inner beast. You can add a few inches to your vertical and shave a couple tenths off your 40; perhaps more importantly, preparation gives you confidence. I find that if I haven\u0026rsquo;t trained very well, then when a disc goes up, I notice doubts creeping into my mind. I second-guess how high I can jump; I wonder if my guy is faster or stronger than I am; I worry about being skied. But if I\u0026rsquo;m confident in my training and preparation, then when the long throw goes up, my first thought is, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s mine!\u0026rdquo; And that\u0026rsquo;s pretty much the only thought in my head until the disc is (or isn\u0026rsquo;t) in my hand.\nIf you are going to be thinking while the disc is in the air, then one useful thing to concentrate on is your \u0026ldquo;launch pad\u0026rdquo;—the place you ideally want to be jumping from. The one-on-one contest for a long throw is actually two contests: the first is a race for position, the second a test of who can leap higher. To win the race for position, get your body between your opponent and the launch pad as quickly as possible. Then, ideally, you\u0026rsquo;ll decelerate as you approach the launch pad, while using your body to box out/maintain position until the jump. (You want to put yourself into position to decelerate because you jump highest when you\u0026rsquo;re neither sprinting all-out nor standing still). If you can win this contest for position, then it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter as much who can jump higher.\nThere are two good ways to prepare for this battle of positioning. First, when you\u0026rsquo;re practicing long throws with a friend, try to catch each high pass at the highest point possible. This will help give you confidence in your own assessment of your leaping ability. In other words, you will practice figuring out where your launch pad is. (A common error in deep receiving/defending is that a player focuses on where and when the opponent is jumping, rather than the optimum point for his/her jump). Second, when you\u0026rsquo;re playing games of \u0026ldquo;500\u0026rdquo; with a couple of friends of similar height, try playing with \u0026ldquo;no jumping allowed\u0026rdquo; rules. This will force you to focus on out-positioning, rather than simply out-jumping, your opponent.\n"

  "author": "Chris Talarico",
  "issue": "004",
  "content": "If your man starts heading deep and you hear an up-call, you have to assume the thrower is putting up a huck\u0026hellip;so, obviously, you\u0026rsquo;ve got to try to beat your guy to the spot.\nBack to Ultimate 101 for a second: if you were guarding the last guy in the stack, you probably have last-back responsibilities. An unguarded deep look is a lot more dangerous than an open under cut, so make sure the deep is shut down first. That means if you haven\u0026rsquo;t communicated to your next deepest defender that you are going to follow your man in, you\u0026rsquo;ve got to remain the deepest player on the field, and not get sucked underneath.\nNow from the point where you\u0026rsquo;re one on one with your guy as he goes out\u0026hellip;when you hear the up-call, I would not turn to find the frisbee at first. More than likely, your guy is going to take you in the direction you need to go—it\u0026rsquo;s most important to stay with him until you have the chance to find the frisbee without losing a step. Therefore, accelerate with your man, and once you get up to speed, then turn your head to find the disc. Since you just followed this guy underneath (and were facing the handlers), you should have a pretty good idea where the throw is coming from—at the least, you know which side of the field the disc is coming from. This information will let you know which shoulder to look over (if it\u0026rsquo;s not obvious).\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important to make as quick an assessment of where the disc is going as possible—you don\u0026rsquo;t want to be running downfield looking backwards (I don\u0026rsquo;t know much about proper sprinting form, but something tells me this isn\u0026rsquo;t going to get you moving as fast as possible). Take a peek, then get your head back around and sprint—look back again only periodically. Each time you locate the disc, be working to out-position your opponent. Whoever takes the straightest line to where the disc ends up has the best chance of making the play.\nIn the event that you\u0026rsquo;re guarding a more athletic player, you are most likely going to want to force that person underneath. That means when he cuts in, you follow him in with the intent of staying close, but not to try to actually get in front and get a block. Your first priority is preventing this player from beating you deep—again, giving up a 10-yard gainer underneath is better than a huck over the top. So since you\u0026rsquo;re following him in, when he stops and turns to go out, you\u0026rsquo;re now a step ahead of him. Use your body! Do not be afraid of contact here—make him run through you to get deep. As he turns around he\u0026rsquo;s going to have to get around you, so block his path. If he tries to get around your right side, step right. If he goes left, move left. Move your feet and be ready to turn your hips to run downfield. Get in his way to stop his momentum, then (or at the same time) turn and accelerate!\n"

Ideally, one defender would be the quick/squirrelly type with a good mark to challenge him around the disc and apply pressure on the mark. The second defender would be fast and preferably able to out-jump this person, with the intention of continuing to push him deep (but maybe not quite as much as in the first half). The idea behind two defenders with two different objectives is to keep this offensive person off balance. Requiring a person to constantly switch roles in order to be effective is preferable to letting them stay in whatever zone they are in.\nStarting the second half, have the quick marker start out (because the offender is already in a groove going deep), and unless they are wildly successful (i.e. handblock), switch defenders the next O point. If a couple cycles of that doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, there\u0026rsquo;s always zone until half-field.\n"

Individual defensive match ups are an odd thing, and it can be difficult to predict which defender would be most effective. Given the past experience of this player being most effective as a deep thrower, I would continue to push them away from the disc. I would try different defenders on them until finding a player who could be successful in keeping the player away from the disc, and in containing their deep game.\nAs a second possibility, if my team had a strong zone defense, and this player was the opposing offense\u0026rsquo;s primary weapon, I would consider playing a \u0026ldquo;box- and-one\u0026rdquo; zone. Match up someone individually on the skilled deep thrower, and play zone with the other six defenders. This makes it difficult for that one player to get the disc, and limits his/her throwing options after receiving the disc.\nAbove all, a defense\u0026rsquo;s best weapon is to be unpredictable. Throwing different looks at this player, and at the opposing team\u0026rsquo;s offense in general, forces them to constantly adjust, and to do things differently than they\u0026rsquo;re accustomed to. This often leads to small mistakes or miscues that the defense can capitalize on.\n"

  "title": "Containing A Big Thrower",
  "author": "Mike Whitaker",
  "issue": "003",
  "content": "The best strategy for containing good deep throwers depends in part on the type of handler position they are playing. If the thrower is frequently in a dump reset position, the number one priority must be that he does not get the disc moving up field. A good thrower with momentum and a trailing mark is deadly. You will often find a defender guard this player well for the first two or three resets and then the defender will get impatient. They\u0026rsquo;ll start to overplay the dump in an effort to get the block and will get beat upline or they\u0026rsquo;ll get lazy with body position and fail to take away the upline cut with their body. The number one priority for defending a dangerous deep thrower lined up near or behind the disc is that they must catch the disc with their momentum moving away from the attacking endzone.\nIf the thrower is playing upfield, I would try to have our defender play more honest D if they were beaten consistently in the first half. To make the thrower\u0026rsquo;s life more difficult, I would instruct our dump defenders to \u0026ldquo;sponge\u0026rdquo; or poach the dumps when the dangerous thrower has the disc. Basically, for the first two seconds the thrower has the disc, the dump defenders should jump into the throwing lane. Again, this strategy is designed to disrupt the rhythm of the thrower and prevent the easy momentum huck. It is also designed to get the disc out of the most dangerous player\u0026rsquo;s hands and to see if the team\u0026rsquo;s other throwers can beat us in a pressure situation.\nAs for they type of defender, I would first try putting my team\u0026rsquo;s best marker on the thrower. By best marker, I mean the player who is always active on the mark and best understands what the hucker wants to throw. The best way for a marker to limit the damage from a hucker is to make the hucker uncomfortable at release. This can mean making the hucker take an extra pivot, causing him to extend an extra couple inches beyond the normal release point, causing the release to be rushed, or the follow through to be shortened. Good huckers have favorite release points and normal rhythms of throwing where they are most dangerous. Disrupt these by taking huckers out of their comfort zones and you greatly increase the odds of your defender having a shot at blocking the huck. In the end, with a good thrower, all you can really ask your defense to do is to increase the odds of a throw that isn\u0026rsquo;t perfect and can be D\u0026rsquo;ed.\nI would try the revised strategy for the first three to four D points of the second half and make their thrower adjust to the different defensive look. If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, I\u0026rsquo;d likely go back to the force the thrower deep strategy at that point and shift one of my top receiver defenders to covering him.\n"

  "issue": "003",
  "content": "Well\u0026hellip;the answer to a situation like this (defending a handler in the lanes) is going to be dependant on a number of factors and variables that are unknown in this scenario (athletic ability, height, speed, etc.). However, in a general sense, if you have one of the main players on the opposing team drastically altering their game due to your defensive strategy then your defensive strategy is effective. Forcing a \u0026ldquo;main handler\u0026rdquo; to strike and cut downfield is a great situation for the defensive team. This means that the handler is not quarterbacking the offence, and they are potentially getting in the way of the primary lane cutters.\nAs such, I would not be concerned at all if the handler was in the lanes and has made a couple of lucky catches. Can they continue to do it for the rest of the game? Can the offence continue to convert at a high rate with secondary players running the show and making the big throws? I doubt it and odds are good that a comeback will be on in the second half.\nAs far as defender choice—I would always choose a taller more athletic defender on a strong handler. On our team we have had very good success with Andrew Lugsdin marking up against all-star handlers. His agility allows him to be able to stay with the short quick cuts and his size helps him to play underneath and \u0026ldquo;push the handler away from the disc.\u0026rdquo;\n"

  "author": "Ben Van Heuvelen",
  "issue": "003",
  "content": "On defense, your goal isn\u0026rsquo;t to shut down all options , because that\u0026rsquo;s impossible against a good offense. Rather, your goal is to dictate to the offense those options it can take. So, the first thing to realize here is: if Big Thrower hasn\u0026rsquo;t been able to make big throws, you\u0026rsquo;ve done something successful.\nThe question to ask yourself now: Is Big Thrower hurting us more now as a deep receiver than he/she usually does as a thrower?\nA few successful deep goals shouldn\u0026rsquo;t automatically make you change your tactics. If, for example, you\u0026rsquo;ve also gotten a few turnovers on the other team\u0026rsquo;s handlers because they aren\u0026rsquo;t used to running their handler set without Big Thrower, then maybe those turnovers offset the damage of Big Thrower running deep. I.e., maybe having Big Thrower go deep is a good tradeoff, given the other disruptions it\u0026rsquo;s causing to their offense.\nBut then let\u0026rsquo;s assume that their offense is running pretty smoothly, or that the errors in their offense have little to do with the way you\u0026rsquo;re covering Big Thrower. In that case, the most important thing is to keep Big Thrower off balance. Even great throwers have a hard time switching from a deep receiver mentality to a deep thrower mentality mid-game — so force Big Thrower to (try to) make that switch, and make the switch as hard as possible. A few ways to do this:\nA. Defend Big Thrower by preventing him from going deep — physically prevent him: defender should keep keep his body between Big Thrower and the endzone.\nB. If the defender commits himself to superior positioning, then speed and quickness are probably more important here than height.\nC. Defender should be an excellent marker. Stay close enough to Big Thrower so that you can put a mark on him as soon as he catches it. Don\u0026rsquo;t go for a layout D on an in-cut unless you\u0026rsquo;re reasonably sure you can get it.\nD. A vast majority of the best hucks are released in flow, before stall three. So put a \u0026ldquo;no huck\u0026rdquo;/flat mark on Big Thrower for stalls one and two. (Most throwers, especially huckers, don\u0026rsquo;t look to break the mark until stall 3, anyway.) To do this, marker should focus on mirroring his shoulders with the thrower\u0026rsquo;s shoulders, staying on toes, eyes on thrower\u0026rsquo;s chest, arms wide.\nBeing a great player, Big Thrower is going to get the disc, and is probably going to get off a couple of good hucks. So: measure your defensive success here not by asking \u0026ldquo;did you shut him down?\u0026rdquo; but by asking \u0026ldquo;did you successfully dictate his options?\u0026rdquo; Specifically, two questions:\n1. Did you prevent him from getting open deep?\n2. Did you prevent him from hucking on stall 1-2?\nIf yes, then you\u0026rsquo;ve done as well as you\u0026rsquo;re going to do. At least in the context of a person-to-person defense. Zone/junk defense options are also worth considering, but that\u0026rsquo;s a different story.\n"

  "content": "This week\u0026rsquo;s question is essentially asking what do you do if your original game plan and strategy for how to play a certain player doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be working. In this case, I would consider coming up with multiple different strategies for minimizing that players\u0026rsquo; apparent strengths. Here are four possible strategies (and in the order I would attempt them) for dealing with a player with dominant throws:\n1. Front her to try and deny her the disc on any easy pass, forcing her to make plays in a way that is not her preference (i.e. going deep to try and catch goals instead of throw them). This strategy is what I would always try first, but in the scenario outlined, it didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be working. While you might abandon this strategy for awhile, don\u0026rsquo;t forget to try it again later in the game.\n2. Guard her on her inside hip so that you can always see both your woman and the disc and try and push her out wide to the open side. This is a containment-type defense where you concede certain passes but try to take away the player\u0026rsquo;s most damaging un-marked throws. This positioning should make a handler stay near the disc because she would seem more open cutting in than away, but the defender is close enough to make a play on a bad pass, or put on a mark if she does catch it. A good marker is vital for this defense. By positioning yourself in the inside-out space, you ensure that she is less likely to catch a pass on the break-side and get off a huck. When she catches the disc, the sideline should yell, \u0026ldquo;Thrower!\u0026rdquo; to alert the downfield D that a huck might be coming. The defense\u0026rsquo;s priority is to only have her throw open side hucks so that the downfield D can anticipate where the deep looks are coming from.\n3. If the downfield defense is still getting burned by her long throws, I would then set up a clam defense where the player in question and the other two handlers are marked person-on, while the four remaining players play more of a zone downfield, covering players only when they cut into their space. This should ensure that there is always a defender last back ready to defend any deep pass that gets put up. Even if this defense is only used as a transition D, forcing the offense to adjust to multiple defensive looks during a point can be effective.\n4. The last specific defense I would consider is a box-and-one. Even if it is not windy, this defense can be effective if your opponent is used to relying on its main thrower to run its zone offense. Set up a 3-2-1 zone where the extra person guards the target handler person-on, fronting her and trying to deny any easy reset. If the handler goes deep, the defense will have help from the zone\u0026rsquo;s deep deep defender.\nHow many different defensive looks your team will need to use in a game to shut down a specific player really depends on how good she is and how much her team relies on her. The better the player and the more well-rounded the team, the more quickly they will adjust to a specific defense. That\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s important to have numerous defenses to alternate between so you keep your opponent guessing and you can narrow down what sort of defensive options seem most effective.\n"

  "title": "Make Any Adjustment...Just Make It Now",
  "author": "Ryan Morgan",
  "issue": "003",
  "content": "This is a very interesting scenario because there are so many adjustments that could be made to respond to this player. You could assign a speedy defender to outrun him on the deep cuts, you could assign a tall defender to pull down floaty passes, you could assign a physical defender to disrupt the flow of his cuts, you could keep playing the same defense on him but put a straight-up mark on everyone else, you could go zone, you could play last back, or you could even throw your scouting report out the window and let him hang around the disc.\nIn my opinion, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter what adjustment you make as long as you make one. This player, who is used to hanging around the disc, has clearly gotten comfortable playing downfield against your defense. The absolute worst thing you can do is to not do anything. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if your best defender was guarding him in the first half, you can\u0026rsquo;t just say \u0026ldquo;try harder\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t get beat deep anymore.\u0026rdquo; At this point in an elimination game you have to make an adjustment to get him out of his rhythm. You have to throw a hurdle in his way to show him a different look.\nOnce you disrupt his rhythm he is going to want to go back to his comfort zone — near the disc. At that point, I would return to my scouting report and continue to push him downfield. A different defender should be put on him though, so he doesn\u0026rsquo;t get comfortable again. Since most handlers don\u0026rsquo;t want to work hard, I would put a fast, physical player on him. That way he will have to work to get open knowing the whole time that on a long pass the faster defender will be able to run past him. But that decision just reflects my personal preference on how to guard handlers downfield without knowing more about the teams involved. So there could be a better choice considering the totality of the circumstances. But again, the most important adjustment to make is to make an adjustment.\n"

We have 6 minutes left in halftime, and our captains are getting together to decide if Big Thrower is just having a great half, or if this is a tactical change. To any reasonable statistical measure, we are flipping a coin here. The data just doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist to tell us for sure whether or not this might happen in the second half, and it\u0026rsquo;s gonna be a gut call if we want to switch tactics. Is this their new playing style, or will our scouting report come around before that 15th goal?\nMy gut usually sticks with the scouting report; I have a lot of faith in how I scout teams, and if I was sure 50 minutes ago that this guy is a better thrower than cutter, well, 50 minutes and some lost sweat shouldn\u0026rsquo;t change that. In fact, nothing in the first half has contradicted our report\u0026hellip;heck, if we had been pushing him towards the disc, maybe we are already down 8-5 or 8-4. This might just be his day.\nIf my team is a pressure-D kind of team, then that gives me another reason to stick with the ‘push him out\u0026rsquo; strategy. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to let up on their offense as a unit, giving them a free reset to their best player, just because of a couple of goals. This is, to me, just too reactionary. If the situation were reversed, and we had a player that was typically big/fast that we liked to push under\u0026hellip;but he threw 3 good hucks in the first half\u0026hellip;I would be more likely to switch now, since we would be amping up our own pressure on those hucking to him. Now we are trying to play our game better, rather than worry about what THEY do\u0026hellip;all that matters is us once that first pull goes up. Any adjustment we make should be secondary towards improving what WE do, not just trying to not lose to them.\nSo, I\u0026rsquo;m reluctant to change thoroughly and start forcing toward the disc.\nHow can we steal some blocks from a gifted player?\nFirst off, I am likely to change some of our other matchups. I\u0026rsquo;ll put my smartest/biggest defender on their worst downfield thrower, and let them know to keep their head up and bust deep to go for double-covers on hucks to Big Thrower. We might give up an under-cut to their worst thrower, but we might catch them going back to the well once too often. I might put my smartest/quickest defender on their worst handler, and have them poaching into the lanes to block hucks from that flat region about 5 yards downfield of the disc. In either case, I am looking to my experienced off-ball defenders to make this a team game instead of a series of 1-v-1 matchups while their best player has the NBA Jam flying disc. Why do you think great D-teams always have at least 2 guys over 30 years old out there? Experienced defenders can make the kind of adjustments that don\u0026rsquo;t force you to abandon your game plan.\n(I cannot fully express my outrage at the opposite; inexperienced defender with the \u0026ldquo;at least my guy didn\u0026rsquo;t do anything, so I did MY job\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;what, guarding the end-zone isn\u0026rsquo;t your job? Guarding the disc isn\u0026rsquo;t? What good are you if you care more about the guy standing in the stack than you do about the plastic they keep catching. Can you imagine someone feeling vindicated that they were a great defender because they successfully stood in the corner with Derek Fisher while Kobe scored 60? Go get in the game, or get off the line and let someone who isn\u0026rsquo;t scared to be in a poster make us a better team).\nI like rotating different defenders on this player, especially since this lets me do some gambling against their pull play. If I smell a huck play, I\u0026rsquo;m putting in a bigger defender and fronting\u0026hellip;let\u0026rsquo;s get aggressive and ask them to huck against someone that, before this half, they would not have wanted to go deep on. If I feel like a throw is coming, I\u0026rsquo;m obviously coming with my marker.\nI\u0026rsquo;m telling my team at halftime that their offense is going through one player right now; he\u0026rsquo;s scored half of their goals and they are relying on him for everything from deep cuts to throws to their primary decoy. We start shutting him down, and we can bring their house of cards tumbling down. This reliance on one player is our opportunity. Sure, they are a great team, and sometimes a great team wins with a 2-point halftime lead\u0026hellip;but let\u0026rsquo;s grind out some yards on offense and start playing 21-on-1 against their star, and see who breaks first. We have the team to do it, the offense to take care of what it needs to take care of, and it\u0026rsquo;s on us to prove that what we have done in practice this year, and on the track, and in the weight room is worth it. Get on that guy, mess with him game. Get your teammates back, fly to the ball when it hits the air. Let\u0026rsquo;s enforce our game on this patch of grass, and win or lose we are going to show them a level of defense they aren\u0026rsquo;t ready for.\n"

  "author": "Nancy Sun",
  "issue": "003",
  "content": "Adjustments made before during a game can win\u0026hellip;or lose a game. Pre-game scouting reports or prior encounters can give clues for how each team\u0026rsquo;s offense and defense should come out of the gate. However, there is no substitute for actually playing the game and making real-time evaluations. There is a fine line to walk between jumping the gun on an adjustment and not acting soon enough and I think that one of the hardest jobs of a team strategist is this evaluation and subsequent decision for adjustment or non- adjustment.\nIn the given situation, it sounds like the defense tried to take away the opponents first option (banking on a low likelihood of being beat on the opponent\u0026rsquo;s second or subsequent option), but the opponent made an effective pre-game adjustment, and kudos to them. Halftime is a natural time for adjustments to be made to happen and in this particular situation, I would absolutely change up the defensive plan.\nIn close games, teams trade points, teams take turns going on runs, and at the most basic level, teams settle into a rhythm. One of the goals of a defense should be to make the offense uncomfortable, and clearly the opposing team is feeling pretty at ease with their star thrower being forced away from the disc. The decision for whether the defensive adjustment is a zone, clam, a straight up mark, backing man defense, etc., should be made with your team\u0026rsquo;s strengths (and other external factors, like weather) in consideration. If the decision is to stay with man defense, the other factor to consider is the type of defender to put on the thrower. For example, on other team\u0026rsquo;s big throwers, there can be much success to be had with rotating smaller-in-stature handler defenders who specialize in challenging the dump pass with more physical defenders who cover and hold lots of ground on D and provide a huge mark.\nWhichever method ends up being chosen, the goal with the defensive adjustement should be to disrupt the offense\u0026rsquo;s rhythm enough to get a couple turns (and defensive scores) and shift the momentum of the game.\n"

  "issue": "003",
  "content": "As a wise woman once said (props to those who get the joke), never lose a game without playing zone. I think this thought answers the question but taken to a broader sense: never get beat over and over again without changing something.\nSo your scouting report was wrong or the team has adjusted to all their opponents having the same scouting report on their strong player. This happens very often with great, specialized players. If an amazing receiver gets forced under enough she will become a great thrower. Now what do you do in this situation in real-time?\nFirst, play zone. If you are worried about a one on one match up, the best way to increase your chances is to allow more defenders to contribute to the match up’s offensive obstacles. Lots of zones would work, but particularly difficult for many all-star players are box and one zones or transition zones. If you play box and one then you are guaranteed to have at least a 2 on 1 situation in all deep looks (your deep-deep and your player on vs. the other team’s star) AND if she goes back to being a throwing threat, you have your player on (maybe with a straight up mark) and a wall of three close behind making her life miserable as a thrower. One thing to be cautious of with a transition zone is to make sure you transition a strong defender onto their main player—sometimes it is worth taking a little extra time or giving up a few free-ish passes to get your match ups straight.\nSecond, take note of who has been throwing it to the player in question. Would a straight up mark help, either in discouraging the throws or pushing throws out of bounds? Do the throwers have equally good forehand and backhand hucks (maybe try forcing a different direction)? Maybe getting closer and more aggressive on the mark would really help keep those long throws from going up. I have also known some teams to foul on the mark in this situation. Though I do not encourage this as a strategy (at least not until we have foul limits for individual players), you may want to encourage your marks to be so aggressive that they MIGHT foul.\nThird, ditch the scouting report. Back the heck out of the player in question. Who cares what she’s done earlier in the season, the way she’s beating you in this game is what you need to deal with at the moment. This can also be used in conjunction with a change in marking strategy.\nOne other thing I’d like to mention is an interesting strategy I’ve heard for how to get match ups to work. It’s all good and well to put your best defender on the other team’s best player, but if the other team is deeper and generally has more strong players on the field than your team does, you can think about doing what I call the \u0026ldquo;Tennis Shift.\u0026rdquo;\nIn tennis team matches, there are positions 1 through 5 with 1 being the highest (best) players and 5 being the lowest (weakest) players. Sometimes, to win more of these match ups within a match, a team will shift its 5 spot player to the 1 spot and shift the rest of their match ups down. This basically concedes the 1 spot to the opponent, but you have a way better chance at winning the other match ups and maybe the match as a whole. The way this can be applied to ultimate is that you have 1 through 7 defenders to mark 1 through 7 offenders. If you don’t think their #1 is guardable by your #1 defender, try putting your #7 on their #1 and try to win all your other match ups in such a way that the impact their #1 makes is greatly reduced by the players around her being shut down.\nNow, to be fair, I haven’t actually tried the Tennis Shift. My thought is that it could work, but you might not necessarily put #7 on #1 it might be a relative shift. It is very important to think about match ups. Some other things to think about might be putting your tallest defender on the player in question if she is beating you based on height or use your fastest defender if she is beating you on speed.\n"

  "title": "Old School Vs. New School",
  "author": "VY Chow",
  "issue": "003",
  "content": "There seems to be two diverging philosophies on how to defend against a very skilled deep thrower that has also hurt you going deep. The first philosophy is perhaps considered old school, focusing on team defense and changing the team\u0026rsquo;s defensive strategy. The second, new school, philosophy is what I like to call the \u0026ldquo;hack-a-Shaq\u0026rdquo; tactic, and although not exactly the same as its namesake, the results are comparable. The hack-a-Shaq consists of intentionally fouling the thrower to significantly disrupt the offensive flow (and deep shot) without consequence to the defending team and, I hate to say, is indelibly efficacious.\nCurrently, I still prefer the so-called old school strategy of changing up the team D. I somehow feel the second is a violation of SOTG but will freely admit that it is increasingly tough to play against teams that use the hack-a-Shaq approach. The old school philosophy begins with recognizing that the very skilled deep thrower does the most damage to your team when they have the disc on the front half of the field - the ability to open up their team\u0026rsquo;s offense with seemingly unstoppable long throws makes lane cutters difficult to defend. There are a few things your team can do to limit the damage this handler does against your team.\nLikely this handler is adept at getting open and thus getting the disc. Pushing them deep is still killing you. One approach is to acknowledge that you can\u0026rsquo;t stop the thrower from either getting the disc (in or out) or putting it deep. To limit the damage, you want to herd and \u0026ldquo;allow\u0026rdquo; the thrower to get the disc on the open side with the defender close enough to put on a mark that will only give up the huck on the open side. Too often, the handler-defender attempts to totally deny this handler from getting the disc and this often backfires with the handler getting the disc in a position without a mark and the whole field in which to throw. This approach relies heavily on downfield D, and this might still be ineffectual even if you try and help deep or do a lot of switching. So what next?\nThe next strategy is to play some sort of zone or poachy, junky D for a few passes or until half field and then switch to man. The basic idea of the junk/zone is to reduce the ability for the O to isolate lane cutters deep, push them into help, and once you\u0026rsquo;ve shortened the field and taken away the dangerous deep threat, switch back to man. A further move is to play zone/junk D with man D on that handler. The goal of this is to make it more difficult to get the disc to the handler, neutralize the deep threat with the zone/junk D, and to encourage the O to get the disc to less dangerous players - this is obviously a combination of two basketball tactics (1) variations of the box and one with your zone/junk D and (2) making it easier to put the ball in the hands of someone who ain\u0026rsquo;t the best shooter and let them shoot.\nThe hack-a-Shaq philosophy is extremely effective and used in both the men\u0026rsquo;s and women\u0026rsquo;s games. This strategy is implemented a couple different ways. One method is to constantly bump and foul the thrower in the first 5-6 seconds and then step back as the count gets higher to avoid the foul call and to avoid resetting the stall to zero. Teams generally don\u0026rsquo;t want to call fouls in the first few seconds because this stops the flow of the offense and the D gains a tremendous advantage to survey the field with the stoppage in play. However, if you don\u0026rsquo;t call the foul, then your O has missed the first and/or second shot because you couldn\u0026rsquo;t get the throw off and often your O is onto your 3rd or 4th option. So, do you call a foul and stop play or do you hope that your O is running on all cylinders that day?\nAnother hack-a-Shaq method is to intentionally foul the thrower only when they attempt to throw (open/break, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter) and the marker doesn\u0026rsquo;t contest the foul call. Obviously this approach is also very effective as the deep throw, or any throw, is unlikely to be completed and even when it is, the thrower is always being hit and hacked when they throw. In the women\u0026rsquo;s game, this approach of \u0026ldquo;intentional fouling during the throw\u0026rdquo; seems to be more prevalent than the the first type of hack-a-Shaq strategy I described. It feels like this type of hack-a-Shaq is becoming more and more common in the women\u0026rsquo;s game over the last couple of years.\nThere isn\u0026rsquo;t anything in the rules against either of these hack-a-Shack defensive strategies. They are overwhelmingly effective not only in taking away the offensive flow but can cause even a seasoned handler to lose their composure under the constant physical duress. I have to say that as more and more teams move towards either version of the hack-a-Shaq philosophy, it becomes harder and harder for me to cling to SOTG and stay with the old school approach. Perhaps it has nothing to do with SOTG, but is simply a further evolution of the game. The efficacy of the hack-a-Shaq tactic is certainly persuasive but before it becomes systemic, I wonder and perhaps hope there will be some change in the rules to even the playing field for the offense (not to mention, the constant stoppages of play is unfriendly to viewers). One thought is to tally uncontested marking fouls and after a certain number of uncontested marking fouls, the O gets to advance the disc 10-15yards thereafter for each additional uncontested marking foul. But that is straying into a whole different issue. For now, we will be sticking with the old school D.\n"

  "content": "I like to look at the bigger picture before making adjustments for just one player. (This is assuming you have used the same strategy in previous meetings and have been successful).\nAssumptions\n1. The third goal was scored in the normal flow of the O (whether Man or Zone).\n2. Two goals were scored while the D was in a straight man D, ie no zone transition.\n3. The game is not determined by the wind, ie a windy upwind/downwind game.\n1. How has the D squad performed in the first half?\nA. Did the D squad generate turnovers during the first half at a higher rate than if the O player was handling, but the D squad did not convert those turnovers into goals? If the D is generating turnovers, pull play excepted, then this probably indicates that the D is playing well and you may only want to make small tweaks to the D and not worry so much about that one player. A small tweak could be to insert a strong O player (one who is very good on D) onto the D line in certain situations to improve the D team scoring efficiency.\nB. Did the O squad not turn the disc over at all? If this is the case, then it might be time to adjust your overall strategy. This could involve playing a zone, a zone transition, or a different type of man D based upon the conditions.\n2. What type of hucks did the player catch, including the pull play huck.\nA. Were they hucks off of a break mark? This indicates a breakdown in team defensive strategy or in executing the team defensive strategy.\nB. Were the hucks made by players you want to make hucks? That is, was the player who hucked it a weak thrower, but just happened to make a great throw? (It happens). This should not necessarily indicate that the strategy for the one player needs to change.\nC. Was the defensive player in a position to make a play on each of the hucks, including the pull play? If he is playing good D and is in a position to make plays, unless you have a player who matches up better against that player, you would probably want to keep your best defensive matchup player against him. (Note that I did not indicate your best defensive player overall, as this might not necessarily generate the best results defensively).\nBy answering these questions you can best identify if your current strategy is working and make adjustments as necessary as a team, and on an individual player level. Secondly, if you do make adjustments, I feel the adjustments must stay within the framework of your defensive strategy.\n"

If they do, you make them do it again, because it’s their f***ing weakness!\u0026rdquo; — Jon Gewirtz\nThis situation is so similar to what Jam did with Damien Scott in the 04 finals that I almost think that \u0026ldquo;The Huddle\u0026rdquo; ripped it right off of the video. All season long, Damien had handled. He wasn’t a great hucker, but he could always get open for a reset and hand a very nice forehand inside out. (Want to see it? Watch the \u0026lsquo;04 videos).\nUntil the finals, Alex Nord had been covering Damien and really destroying him. Nord is big, quick and tenacious, but doesn’t have Damien’s out-and-out foot speed in the open field. In the final, Damien ran deep, Idris Nolan ripped it to him, and Jam got easy scores. We made an adjustment by putting Blaine Robbins on Damien. Blaine was much less experienced, but fast enough to keep pace with Damien and we got two blocks out of it. But mostly we followed Jonny’s advice and worked to limit Damien’s reset and throwing opportunities and shrugged our shoulders when he went deep.\nKirk Savage of Furious used deep cuts successfully throughout his entire career. The best defense we used against him were flexible, experienced defenders. Typically, if a handler runs downfield from the area right around the disc, defenders will let them go. Why bother chasing them when you know they’re coming back to the disc? But if you let Kirk go, he’d be gone and you’d be postered. So the experienced defender would pursue immediately when he made a move to go downfield.\n"

Box-and-One Defense: A great way to get an offense that relies heavily on one player off-balance. Also does a good job of frustrating a player that likes to touch the disc often. Sandwich Star Player On Stop Disc: Force a secondary player to get the disc underneath to start their offense. Suggested Individual Tactics\nSwitch Match Ups On Star Player: Alternate a tall player that encourages the player to cut under and provides a wide, intimidating mark with the quickest, fastest, high energy defender to pester the player. Make The Star Player Work On Defense: Some offensive studs don\u0026rsquo;t enjoy playing defense. Make sure once you get the turn that you run him ragged. Push The Star Under: Since the star player has scored deep a couple times force him under, but mark him straight up to force him to settle for the little throws. "

  "content": "I\u0026rsquo;ll go ahead and assume we\u0026rsquo;re pulling, so that will give our guy what we hope to be two chances to make up for the first half, even the score, and allow us to see if what was said at halftime served any purpose; or was the guy simply standing there nodding his head like a boxer, in one ear and out the other, all the while wondering if he should\u0026rsquo;ve run off to the Honey Bucket or maybe he should put on a different wrist band, maybe someone has some tape he can borrow, maybe some Gu will help, maybe some Red Bull, maybe he should go mess around in his bag and look for something he knows isn\u0026rsquo;t there—the things they didn\u0026rsquo;t carry.\nThere are times when, despite your effort, you have to tip your hat and take 70. And of course there are other times when you have to say, f*** all that s***, enough is enough. My feeling is that if this troublemaker is a handler, then make him handle. I\u0026rsquo;m not against fronting him in order to push him away from the disc, so I\u0026rsquo;d only buy in to half of that scouting report. It\u0026rsquo;s important to keep in mind that he\u0026rsquo;s not a handler by himself. That is, he\u0026rsquo;s has someone to complete the chemistry and that guy may be the one to really clamp down on. Someone else has to step in and step up and place tremendous pressure on the other handler. And hopefully that defender isn\u0026rsquo;t addressed directly and instructed to step up. Simply, they know the drill and what\u0026rsquo;s at stake and their game becomes something that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t before, because obviously that is what our opponent has done with his game. And perhaps some gamesmanship is in order: during a stoppage you whisper under your breath, \u0026ldquo;Whatcha you gonna do, fluffy? You taking me deep? You gonna go deep?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd then again maybe not.\nAbove all else, I\u0026rsquo;m looking at two defenders who know how to play an off-man high count; I\u0026rsquo;m lucky if I can get one. So other than me, I\u0026rsquo;m looking for someone a little more than half-witted. Immune to exhaustion with an overall toughness about them and smart enough to know that once you\u0026rsquo;ve earned the turn, you have to score, and while doing that, tire this guy out as much as you can to make him twice the liability on the next point. If the right adjustments have been made, then this stud will get more points in the 2nd half than he did in the first. Maybe that proves to be the difference and he gets extended and maybe a bit frustrated because the O isn\u0026rsquo;t clicking like they did in the first half. And maybe, just maybe, he finds his place in the sun in the second half and then you and your team, but probably just you, walk off seemingly content in knowing that the reward is in the effort, and sometimes that\u0026rsquo;s all there is.\n"

  "issue": "003",
  "content": "Whenever lining up against a gifted opponent I have always found it helpful to ask myself: what does this player want to do? In this case, this player is most comfortable and probably most confident in a handler role, staying behind the disc and throwing goals rather than receiving them. When playing against teams that have a player like this, someone who excels in many aspects, always make them beat you with their Plan B or Plan C, never Plan A.\nWhen playing Brown in 2005 (the year they ended up winning nationals) we knew what they wanted to do. They wanted to isolate Zip (Josh Ziperstein), and allow him to do what he does best: fake someone silly and bust deep. This would usually happen when their best thrower that year (Vandenberg) had the disc. This was an incredibly effective strategy for them. They had the best player in college ultimate that year (maybe ever) and one of the best pure throwers. This was their Plan A: Zip go deep, Vandenberg throw deep. When playing Brown that year in quarterfinals of Centex (the last game they lost!) we wanted to make sure that if they beat us, it would not be because we couldn\u0026rsquo;t stop Zip going deep. So, we put one of our best defenders on him (Gigo Valdivia) with instructions to back Zip and let him get the disc underneath. We wanted to force Brown out of their comfort zone, which I believe we did. We ended winning an epic game on universe point.\nIn this above described situation, I think you need to go into the second half feeling confident number one. You are down a break to a team that isn\u0026rsquo;t beating you the way they want. Sure they are happy to be up, but as this game wears on they will unconsciously (or consciously) want to return to what got them there: their thrower throwing, not receiving, deep discs. Here\u0026rsquo;s what I tell my team going into the second half: so far we are executing our strategy, but the results aren\u0026rsquo;t there. What we need to do is ratchet up the intensity on their throwers. Make it so they don\u0026rsquo;t want the disc in their hands. I would try putting a straight up mark on the players that have been hucking, with the hopes of disrupting or deterring their chances. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to stop every huck; you just need to do whatever you can to make the throw less than perfect. Downfield I would put one of, if not our best deep defender on the player beating us deep. I woud continue to front him, but maybe not by as much. I would also instruct the players on the weak side of the field, to look for opportunities to help deep if an uncontested huck does go up. I would also make sure to remind my players that we are doing what we are supposed to do, have confidence in the game plan and make your opponent feel the pressure of playing outside their comfort zone.\nIn the end, if a team is able to beat you going outside their game plan\u0026hellip;well, hats off to them. But allowing them to beat you how they want to beat you is unacceptable. And if the strategy you went into the game with still isn\u0026rsquo;t working late in the second half, maybe you just want to jump ship. Try force middle, even going zone or switching the matchup you have on their stud. Throw the kitchen sink at them. Make them play how you want them to play, force them to dig into their pockets for Plans C, D and E.\n"

  "issue": "003",
  "content": "This one is pretty straightforward: as with any player, you have to determine what you want to give up and what you want to take away (or try to, anyway). You\u0026rsquo;re going to want to deny any player\u0026rsquo;s greatest strength or whatever facet of his game is capable of hurting you most. If this guy has beaten you repeatedly with his throws, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem like a very good idea to allow him to get the disc underneath - even if he has caught a couple hucks today. You\u0026rsquo;re forcing him to do something he\u0026rsquo;s not as good at, which is preferable to allowing him to do what he\u0026rsquo;s best at.\nSo, without allowing him to come under (which, again, is a BAD idea), you have a couple options:\n1. Continue to use the same defender(s) you\u0026rsquo;ve been using. Make it very clear to your team that this guy now wants the deep pass, so expect the huck and stay in a position that will give you a shot at it if it goes up. Also, make sure your other downfield defenders are looking to help on a deep shot. Still deny the underneath cut first, but don\u0026rsquo;t give as big a cushion (stay 1 or 2 yards underneath him if you had been farther off). This is the least strategic option, but if you\u0026rsquo;re confident in the guy(s) who you\u0026rsquo;ve had guarding him, this might be enough.\n2. You\u0026rsquo;re probably going to need to guard this guy with someone who is faster than he is. Put your best, fastest deep defender on him and continue forcing him out. He\u0026rsquo;s still going to have looks deep, but now he has to beat your best guy if he\u0026rsquo;s going to be successful. Clearly he has been a top option for the other team - your best deep defender will hopefully make them think twice about jacking one to him.\nNOTE: If your best deep defender is not noticeably faster than this guy, you may have to go to someone who is not as great in the air, but can beat the guy with speed to gain position (i.e. beat him to the spot).\n3. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have anyone who can both deny the under and contest the deep throws, you\u0026rsquo;ve got to make more drastic changes. Throw a zone. Play a switching man that keeps at least one defender deep. Play any other defense you have, because clearly you don\u0026rsquo;t have a one-man answer for this guy.\nOr, if you don\u0026rsquo;t like these options, you can go back to shutting down the deep and allow him the underneath\u0026hellip;and kick yourself after you lose for allowing the same guy to beat you the same way. Again.\n"

Most club teams hold some sort of tryout; without adding new talent they are sure to fall off of the map sooner rather than later.\nAt this point in the year, thousands of ambitious players are cleating up to show that they are worth a precious roster spot. We asked our panel to give us their thoughts on the tryout process in general. Their answers demonstrate the complex nature of tryouts, both from the tryout's perspective as well as from the viewpoint of the decision-makers.\nIf you are trying out for a team, or even if you are interested in how captains of various teams approach their tryout process...keep reading. The responses show a commitment to improving each team, but in a variety of different ways.\nBelow are several of the sub-questions we asked to provide structure for the panel's answers:\nDo young players have any chance of making the team as an offensive player? What about as a handler? As a hucker? What would they have to show you to prove their worth? Is calm, conservative play better? Or do you want to see highlight reel moves, throws, and catches? Say you are a young player with a specialty throw (something out of the normal repetoire).

  "issue": "002",
  "content": "Do young players have any chance of making the team as an offensive player? What about as a handler? As a hucker? What would they have to show you to prove their worth?\nSure they do and it depends on their skill set. It\u0026rsquo;s more than likely easier for one to make it as a hucker first; pretty much everyone can huck it. Making it as a primary handler (a \u0026ldquo;1\u0026rdquo;) is somewhat tougher.\nIs calm, conservative play better? Or do you want to see highlight reel moves, throws, and catches?\nI prefer a combination of the two which is possible, but most players can\u0026rsquo;t pull off the balancing act.\nSay you are a young player with a specialty throw (something out of the normal repetoire). You are confident in that throw, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really fit easily into a team\u0026rsquo;s offense (rather, they could change how they play to take advantage of this talent). Should you show this in tryout scrimmages?\nI think so but obviously not all the time and on those turns your defense has to be prettier than your offense was ugly.\nWhat is most important: practices or tournaments?\nThat\u0026rsquo;s not quite a quick answer like the others; but I\u0026rsquo;ll go with practice. Tournaments are the luxury.\nHow should tryouts behave and carry themselves? Some captains and coaches love people that ask a ton of questions, and others want people that want a lot of feedback. Or give their opinions. Or are silent, strong teammates. What are you looking for? Does the personality of a player figure large into whether they can make the team? What about an obnoxious player with tremendous talent?\nTryouts should be determined, with a feel of confidence about them. They should be putting out there what they think the last 10% of 100% is. That measure has never failed me in the past when critiquing others/tryouts. It\u0026rsquo;s probably a collective thinking among those tryouts, in their drive to the site: \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m gonna give these guys 100% today.\u0026rdquo; Okay, great; but what\u0026rsquo;s that last 10% mean to you? What am I looking for? I\u0026rsquo;m looking for the casual approach or an approach that\u0026rsquo;s mostly callow.\nIf personality mattered, or mattered greatly, there\u0026rsquo;d be a great many savage seven squads out there. Aren\u0026rsquo;t most tremendously talented players obnoxious? For those that fit that description as a tryout, I think that\u0026rsquo;s part of their talent and it\u0026rsquo;s something they can work on over the long haul of the season if they survive the cut. And of course this comes down to personnel management and is one of the reason why being a captain can be so damned thankless.\nFor your team, does everyone try out, or are returning players safe? How long are your tryouts? Is this optimal? Is there anything about the tryout process that you think teams should do more often?\nUp until a few season ago, returning players were safe on the team that I competed for. It may have been 2006 when returners had to actually make the team. Funny how some decide to play coed when the word gets out. Tryouts usually run once a week for three weeks; but there\u0026rsquo;s also a weekly pickup or competitive scrimmage during this time as well. Also, there\u0026rsquo;s an early tournament, such as terminus where interested tryouts are invited.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s difficult because of the tourney calendar, but good club teams should make themselves available to college teams early in the semester: provide clinics to teams within their section. 2 or 3 times early in the semester to accommodate all the teams is what I\u0026rsquo;m thinking. I know it\u0026rsquo;d be tough because of all the tournaments, but at least some of the second tier teams could attend, they have ballers too.\n"

  "title": "Athleticism First, Attitude Close Behind",
  "author": "Chris Talarico",
  "issue": "002",
  "content": "The most important things I want to see from a tryout are, in no particular order:\nAthleticism/speed Field sense Confidence with the disc Ability \u0026amp; willingness to take direction The first point speaks for itself. If a player can\u0026rsquo;t run fast, jump, layout, and exhibit a reasonable level of body control, they don\u0026rsquo;t stand much of a chance.\nFor field sense, I want to see that a player knows where the next pass is likely to go. A couple examples:\nWhile on defense, if his man gets a swing pass, does he get upfield and take away the continue pass before getting tight on the mark? Does he keep himself in a position to see both his man and the thrower? On offense, does he clear space if he\u0026rsquo;s not cutting? Does he set up a deep strike when he sees a handler make an open up-line cut? Is he in position to receive a continue pass after a break-side dump? Of course these could go on and on, but what a tryout needs to show is that he\u0026rsquo;s aware of what\u0026rsquo;s happening on the field, and knows where he needs to be.\nI guess confidence with the disc speaks for itself as well. No matter what position someone may want to play, they need to be able to complete passes when faced with a tough, aggressive mark. Shaky forehands and rushed dump passes aren\u0026rsquo;t going to cut it.\nThe last point about taking direction is part personality/attitude, part on- field ability. The on-field part involves being able to adjust your style of play. Too often I\u0026rsquo;ve encountered the problem where a particular defense is called on the line, but is not executed during the point. I want to see a player that doesn\u0026rsquo;t get beat deep when the call is to force your man underneath. I want to see a player be able to change their mark to take away an I-O, if that\u0026rsquo;s what has been called, or to instead stop the \u0026lsquo;around.\u0026rsquo; A player needs to be able to holster a huck - even if it\u0026rsquo;s wide open - if the call is to play conservatively. The longer I\u0026rsquo;ve played, the more important I\u0026rsquo;ve found this last point to be. It\u0026rsquo;s incredibly difficult to win if everyone on the field is not on the same page.\nThose are the main things I look for at tryouts.\nAs for the player with the fancy throws\u0026hellip; as far as I\u0026rsquo;m concerned, tryouts are not a venue to display \u0026ldquo;trick\u0026rdquo; throws, or to take chances with any kind of throw. Disc possession is more important in elite ultimate than at any other level. You\u0026rsquo;re far less likely to get the disc back if you turn it over, so you\u0026rsquo;ve got to prove that you have the ability to complete passes before you show off your newfangled whatchamacallit. I like forehands and backhands\u0026hellip; call me crotchety and conservative, but I\u0026rsquo;m far more inclined to take a player on my team who can complete a safe pass 100% of the time vs. a player who will attempt more difficult throws and turn it over occasionally.\nAdmittedly, that makes for a bit of a stifling situation for a new player who regards himself as a thrower. But really, anyone can take chances - I think a tryout needs to first show that they\u0026rsquo;re capable of playing turnover-free ultimate before opening it up.\n"

  "title": "Focus On What You Can Control",
  "author": "Ryan Morgan",
  "issue": "002",
  "content": "Trying out for a club team is like interviewing for any job. There are some things that are in your control and some things that aren’t. It’s important to focus on the things you can control and understand that the other things aren’t worth worrying about. Even if you are a great thrower, if the team already has great throwers then the 6’9\u0026quot; guy that can’t throw may get selected over you. Here, I’d like to focus on three things that I would like to see from all of my tryouts, regardless of my team’s needs: commitment, willingness to adapt, and decision making.\nFirst, for a tryout to have any chance of making the team he must show his commitment. Elite club ultimate requires a significant time and money commitment. Additionally, a newcomer to the team will require more time during the season to gel with his new teammates. A tryout should show that he is prepared to make the requisite commitment by attending all preseason tryout events. This may require missing family events, having less time to study for a test, or delaying that vacation but an elite club player must make the team a priority. A tryout who misses preseason events severely disadvantages himself.\nSecond, a tryout must show a willingness to adapt to the team’s style. Just because you had the green light to send it in your former team’s huck-n-hope offense doesn’t mean you will have the same luxury with this team. Get a feel for what kind of offense or defense the team is accustomed to running and show you can be an asset in that system. A good rule of thumb is not to try anything unusual unless an established player does it first. Generally speaking, don’t be the first tryout to attempt a 40-yard hammer or a blade to the break side. If you are comfortable with a special throw, show it off during warm-ups and not in-game. Perhaps over the season improvements can be made to the system to take advantage of your skills. But for the tryout period you should adapt your play to the team. The team should not adapt to you. Of course, if you find out that this team plays huck-n-hope too, then huck away!\nThird, every tryout must demonstrate good decision-making. At the elite level every possession matters. Every turnover matters. So, good decision-making that will reduce turnovers is a much more important factor than at lower levels. Sometimes knowing how to play smart is a more important quality that being talented. On my team, a talented player that makes poor decisions will get cut while a less talented player that makes good decisions has a much better shot at making the team. Some examples of good decision-making include:\nSeeing poaches Recognizing mismatches Throwing high percentage passes but knowing when to take calculated risks Appropriately choosing to initiate or not initiate a fast break after a turnover Remaining calm even as the stall count gets high Ultimately, both sides are trying to find the perfect fit for them. As a tryout, as long as you focus on those things you can control including commitment, a willingness to adapt, and good decision making, then you can feel good about your effort. Good luck!\n"

  "title": "Go After Similar, More Experienced Players",
  "author": "Greg Husak",
  "issue": "002",
  "content": "I think the first thing that a player should evaluate is their own talents and strengths. During the tryout you should be focusing on accentuating those strengths when given the chance. If you\u0026rsquo;re a tall deep threat, don\u0026rsquo;t waste time in a scrimmage squirelling around the disc, and in any huck drill make sure you are going up strong to show that you can climb. If you\u0026rsquo;re a squirrely quick guy, make sure you are getting open on all short cuts, and that if there are any sprints to be done that you are winning them all. And with these points in mind, here are a few general tips:\nStay focused. A few lazy turnovers in a seemingly meaningless drill might cause the powers-that-be to write you off or at least notice and inconsistency or lack of focus to detail. That\u0026rsquo;s probably not going to be appreciated on a successful team.\nGive a good effort. It might not be how the \u0026lsquo;cool\u0026rsquo; guys play, or even very efficient, but if you\u0026rsquo;re going hard the people will notice, and that\u0026rsquo;s always a welcome vibe to bring to a team. Never give up on a disc that\u0026rsquo;s in the air, make every cut as hard as possible, make the guy you\u0026rsquo;re guarding in the drill work a little harder\u0026hellip;it\u0026rsquo;s a positive.\nRecognize your strengths and make sure they are exposed in scrimmages. if you\u0026rsquo;re going to make the team you\u0026rsquo;re going to have to be pretty good at something. know what that is, and make sure you\u0026rsquo;re doing it better than others.\nGuard the returners who do your thing as often as possible. If you can do their thing better than them, that\u0026rsquo;s going to be apparent if you are guarding them. If you\u0026rsquo;re making them work harder than usual, that will get filtered up to decision-makers. If you\u0026rsquo;re getting schooled, you\u0026rsquo;ll at least know why you didn\u0026rsquo;t make the team and will have hopefully learned something from a better player than you.\nFinally, be supportive and enthusiastic. All players love to get high- fives from teammates, they love when people get excited about their defense, when people recognize their accomplishments\u0026hellip;don\u0026rsquo;t be sparing with those comments. Also, talk while your team is on defense, even if it\u0026rsquo;s just to one returner.\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s important to recognize that there most likely is some hierarchy, even a subtle one, and that returners are likely above new tryouts. Some teams may have a flatter structure than others, but if you want to get on the team you\u0026rsquo;re likely going to have to displace somebody, so do all the things you can better than some of those above you and hope that the effort and skill are recognized.\n"

  "title": "Hard Work Stands Out",
  "author": "Miranda Roth",
  "issue": "002",
  "content": "At tryouts, I am looking for someone who will fit into the TOP HALF of our roster if they are a new player. I prefer having all-team tryouts so that each member, even if they have played on the team previously, brings great intensity to tryouts — this is the best way to start a season (and the most fair way to choose a team).\nIn terms of skills, this means you need to have all the basics without flaw. For example, you can be the best thrower in the world, but if you refuse to play defense, ta-ta. As a teammate, I’m looking for someone who will support the team, make the (huge) commitment to being at everything possible and be low-maintenance. It’s good to ask questions; it’s bad to ask questions every day of the same person. It’s also good to have a compatible personality — someone that people will enjoy being around has a much greater chance of making the team because we spend so much time together.\nAs far as age, I’m more looking at someone who will either contribute to the team immediately, and hopefully for more than one year OR someone who will learn quickly and has a lot of potential (these are usually the hyper athletes with weaker throws). In my mind, it’s great to be young and want to learn — if this is you, make sure you show the appropriate amount of respect for team captains/coaches/returning players. Young players can make the team as whoever they are, age doesn’t matter that much to me — we have had very experienced, calm young players play great in big games on Riot.\nAs far as what type of play is better — I believe the base should be to be 100% on offense and never let your woman touch the disc on defense. Beyond that, if you can break the mark, throw hucks, sky people, get blocks — show that! But if one of those things isn’t you (they are almost certainly not ALL you), tryouts is NOT the time to start trying. If you are particularly good at something that the team you’re trying out for does not have, make sure you show that at some point during the tryout process.\nI would say the #1 thing I’m looking for in a tryout is someone who works hard. If you work hard every moment of your tryout that will stand out to anyone. Whether you’re at tournaments, practices or track workouts, you better be giving it your all at all times. This includes traits like being on time/early to everything, busting your ass at track (and also having been at the track/weight room prior to tryouts), being healthy for the tryout whenever possible, jogging to water, making eye contact with people explaining drills/offense/etc, and talking from the sideline at tournaments and practices.\n"

  "title": "Perspective From The Team & From A Player",
  "author": "Ben Wiggins",
  "issue": "002",
  "content": "A couple of thoughts that I always have when tryouts roll around:\nAny young player that wants to improve should be trying out for any team possible. Tryout ultimate is typically intense, cheap, and with players that you don\u0026rsquo;t normally play with. This can be an amazing opportunity to improve\u0026hellip;especially with experienced players available that are motivated (or at least ready) to give constructive feedback. This can be a great opportunity for developing players, regardless of your own chances of making the team.\nIf you are invested in making the team, you should know the answer to this question: What is the point of the entire tryout process? It isn\u0026rsquo;t to be fair, and it isn\u0026rsquo;t to give everyone an equal chance. It darn sure is not to find the best 24 players. The point of tryouts is to WIN GAMES.\nFrom the tryout perspective, this means that you should be trying to win scrimmages and win tournament games, first and foremost. Win. Play tough D, hustle to the ball, listen and talk\u0026hellip;do those things that win games. This should trump any advice on how to try out. Assuming that the people picking the team are thinking objectively (which is a big assumption, obviously) they will see those things. If your scrimmage team\u0026rsquo;s best chance of winning is not with you on the field\u0026hellip;well, you probably aren\u0026rsquo;t going to make the team this year (which is fine\u0026hellip;you may as well ignore this assumption for the time being, get onto the field, and improve\u0026hellip;just be realistic about your chances this year). Why should you cheer your scrimmage teammates from the sideline? Because this wins games. Why should you run down on the pull hard? You get the point.\nIf you ever come to a point in a tryout practice where you aren\u0026rsquo;t sure whether you should give full effort or not\u0026hellip;win. Returning players have a history of success on the team, and will be excused for their inability to get up for practices to some extent. You, however, do not have this history. Win drills, win games.\nThe team is trying to pick a team that will win games. If you show yourself to be a player that will give them their best chance of winning, they should take you. This is very different than trying to be their 23rd best player. If you don\u0026rsquo;t make the team, and spend your time thinking about how you are, in fact, better than player #24\u0026hellip;you missed the point. Do you give your team a better chance against Regional Rival X? Would Sectional team Y be dismayed to see you on the roster, or happy?\nThe folks that run tryouts for professional teams get paid of a lot of money, and they make mistakes all the time. These mistakes are both in their process mistakes (how many tryouts, how much intensity, what drills do we run, etc) and in their decision mistakes (which player should we pick). And those are the pros. Non-pro Ultimate players are often running tryouts with no experience or training, and they are doing the best they can with the main goal (Win Games) in mind. Which means they are going to make mistakes of all kinds. Winners deal with these mistakes and give their best, and the rest tend to whine about how they didn\u0026rsquo;t get a fair, open, balanced chance to show they \u0026ldquo;deserved\u0026rdquo; a spot. If you are trying out for a team, understand that the process will be imperfect and be ready for something weird. Maybe you get less time on the field than optimal. Maybe you do drills that aren\u0026rsquo;t geared to your strengths. Maybe you are forced to play in an offense that you don\u0026rsquo;t know well. Deal with it\u0026hellip;when the big games come in September and October, you are going to be out of your comfort zone then, too. Everyone will. Heck, this almost makes the insane tryout process a better process of analysis.\nOn Sockeye, we have what I think is a pretty solid tryout process, but only after years of making mistakes and then making adjustments in the next year (I\u0026rsquo;m not captaining now, but have been involved for the past several years). We have an initial open tryout, where about 100 players come out. Our tryout process is merged with Voodoo, the other open team in town. At least for the past 4 years, everyone has to try out every year: obviously there are people that are at very, very low risk for being cut (Nord is probably going to have to lose 2-3 limbs in order to NOT make the team this year) but everyone else has to perform and show up to camp in shape. After the initial tryout, we cut down to about 35. We make cuts by email or phone, and we give players a chance to tell us which method they would rather receive the news by. We set pretty hard deadlines about when people will hear back from us. After first cuts, we practice with this 35 for 3-4 weeks, then go to a tryout tournament. Tryouts are told that the tournament is the big deal, and we try to teach everything the player needs to know (O, D, positions) before that tournament. If someone blows up at the tournament against good competition then they have a good chance of making the team. I might repeat, I think this is a solid process, but we make mistakes with it every year and every year it improves, hopefully.\nI think team captains need to understand what they are selecting for. I had trouble trying out for a couple of teams as a thrower/handler\u0026hellip;these teams wanted all their new players to simply dump the disc to their veterans. You find out after tryouts that, sweet, you now have 8 new handlers\u0026hellip;none of whom will throw (or can throw) a 30-yard throw. Maybe THAT is why our offense keeps grinding to a halt. Teams need to trust their own teaching and, often, look for the players with character and potential. If the player is a winner and unselfish then they can learn discipline, in my opinion.\nWhen one of my team\u0026rsquo;s takes on a new player, we need to realize that our team is now 1/24th based on the new players skills and mindset. We picked up two vert-stack players? This doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean they need to hurry up and learn horizontal stack like we run\u0026hellip;maybe it is time to incorporate more vert-stack principles into our offense so we can really use those skills. Such are offenses changed to become more effective. We picked up a guy with a crazy I/O flick? Well, 23/24ths are him learning to use that throw within our O, and 1/24th is us learning to adapt how we play to this throw. Same with team motivation, learning style, etc\u0026hellip;you take on the character of your new players. They don\u0026rsquo;t just become robotic clones of last year\u0026rsquo;s retirees.\nLastly, as a tryout, try to focus on things that you can control. If your goal is \u0026ldquo;make the team\u0026rdquo; then you are always going to be at the mercy of the people picking the team. These people may or may not be objective, logical, or fair. Making a goal like \u0026ldquo;play well enough to help my team in every scrimmage or tournament game and give focused effort in every drill\u0026rdquo; is better; it helps you to focus on the things you can control. At the end of the day, you can meet your goal and still not make the team, which is a darn sight better than being crushed that you were cut and then giving up. Make controllable goals.\n"

  "issue": "002",
  "content": "Tryouts are such a weird time for me. It\u0026rsquo;s exciting the season is starting and so many people want to tryout for our team, but at the same time the decisions can be stressful and as much pressure as one might feel when trying out, the team is also some amount of pressure on the team being tried out to find a good fit. Since there are a few different options in Boston, it is very important for our team to put our best foot forward and we try to do it as accurately as possible. We try to have a complementary mix of teaching and evaluating so that people can get a good sense of what the team is like (values, personality, strategic sets, etc) and the team can get a feel for what the tryouts can bring to the table. While there do exist specific skill sets that we look for each season (more on this in a bit), at the core, Brute has always had a strong emphasis on athleticism and strong fundamentals: catching, throwing, good decisions, and man defense. It is also important for us to see that people are coachable and able to adapt to different/new situations. All of these characteristics together paint a pretty accurate picture, albeit an overwhelmingly general one, of the type of player we look for taking on our team.\nAttitude and personality fit, while both are very important intangibles that are taken into consideration, have never been deal breakers for us. One of the reasons for this is because we already have such a diverse range of personality on the team - we have teammates who like to ask questions, teammates who are outspoken, teammates who are silent, teammates who are emotional, teammates who view the glass as half full/half empty, etc - and this is something we embrace and have never had a problem with.\nAt the beginning of every season, we take inventory of the team and evaluate the roles we need to have filled, based both on evaluations of previous seasons and on personnel losses. Every year without fail, one of the hardest roles for us to fill is the dynamic handler (big throws, big target, touch the disc a lot types) and inevitably, we never have enough of them. Some of the other past specific needs have included: deep defenders, stopped disc cutters, possession handlers, and big marks. This isn\u0026rsquo;t to say that we only look for people with certain skill sets, but rather we do tailor practices to focus on teaching and identifying these skills. The general philosophy is to increase the quantity of people on our team that are good at a certain skill, so sometimes we have tryouts who already fit one or more of our needs, but the tryout process is also a lot about teaching and in that case, it is just as important for us to see improvement from weekend to weekend.\nSo I guess this has all been more about the tryout process from a team organizational perspective, but if I had to give anyone advice about trying out for our team, I\u0026rsquo;d just encourage them to be themselves and have fun out there. We try to maintain an atmosphere of openness and transparency, so if anyone has thoughts/ideas/questions, just tell/ask someone. Don\u0026rsquo;t be scared of asking questions or for feedback and don\u0026rsquo;t worry too much about \u0026ldquo;fitting into a system\u0026rdquo;. Work hard, have fun, and play ultimate, because that\u0026rsquo;s what we are all together to do.\n"

  "issue": "002",
  "content": "Here are my six recommendations to anyone who is trying out for a team of any level:\n1. Be on time and have all of the appropriate equipment for the tryout.\n2. Relax — tryouts are a high stress process for everyone involved, but as a captain/coach I\u0026rsquo;m looking to see how players handle themselves throughout the process. Tryouts are a decent representation of how players will handle high-stress situations during tournaments.\n3. Know what you can and can\u0026rsquo;t do — Before you even get to the tryout think about your game, what throws you are confident in, how you have been taught to mark, what assets you think you can bring to the table. Also, remind yourself what you aren\u0026rsquo;t so great at. At the tryout put yourself in situations in which you are likely to succeed. Show off what you can do. Conversely, don\u0026rsquo;t try to do too much. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have a deep flick, don\u0026rsquo;t try it. Throw a good fake if someone is open deep for your flick and make a smart throw underneath.\n4. Go for it! Again, this is your chance to show what you can do, if a play you can make presents itself go do it, and do it with confidence!\n5. Hustle! A coach will always find a spot for someone that is willing to work hard.\n6. Show you are coachable — If a coach suggests something to you, listen, and try to apply the suggestion in the scrimmage.\n"

  "content": "Do young players have any chance of making the team as an offensive player?\nAbsolutely. There are a number of college players that have now played on club teams while still in college (Watson, Heijman, Cahill, Gibson, etc), some while in high school. These players are usually the best offensive players on their teams and have been to college nationals, at least once, if not multiple times. Although they may have inexperience on the club seen, they have crunch time experience and are able to eventually translate that to the club scene.\nWhat about as a handler? As a hucker? What would they have to show you to prove their worth?\nIf you are a handler, you must be composed and make the right throw. This means understanding what the offense is trying to accomplish and what your role is in accomplishing this goal. Upon understanding the goal, the second part is to actually make the decision to make the throw that completes the goal of your offense. Finally, the handler should know the throws in their repertoire.\nUnderstanding what the offense is trying to accomplish and your role to me is key. By understanding the offense, you are able to position yourself for the dump cut (or any cut) that will allow the thrower to make an easy completion and retain the disc. After receiving the disc, this means that you know where other people will be cutting so that you can keep the disc moving to your big throwers.\nWhen watching handlers, I am ok with turnovers during tryouts when the handler made the the throw easy for the person with the disc and subsequently made the right decision in where to throw the disc. Sometimes the throw isn\u0026rsquo;t complete, it happens to everyone. However, if the throw is habitually not completed, catching the disc and making the right decision will take you only so far in the tryout process.\nWhat I am not ok with is:\nWhen the handler looks off a throw that should have been made within the frame of the receiver; or Tries a throw that is not in their repertoire (even if completed). This shows to me a lack of confidence in their throwing ability, not understanding the offense, and/or lack of decision-making abilities. For a hucker, this is usually a down field player. They need to have the ability to gain yards and time their cuts. More importantly, they must be able to make a consistently good choice and throw.\nNote, not every huck is a good huck. This should be made known to the hucker and if they continue to make hucks that are low percentage as they fall out of the framework of your offense, they may not make the team.\nIs calm, conservative play better? Or do you want to see highlight reel moves, throws, and catches?\nI want to see the player play to the best of his skills, abilities, and within the framework of the offense. The highlight reel plays will be a byproduct of doing so.\nSay you are a young player with a specialty throw (something out of thenormal repertoire). You are confident in that throw, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really fit easily into a team\u0026rsquo;s offense (rather, they could change how they play to take advantage of this talent). Should you show this in tryout scrimmages?\nI would recommend throwing it only when the situation dictates. To throw it in any other circumstance, most likely will be a very low percentage throw and probably be looked down upon. However, if you are able to identify the situations in which the throw is highly effective and has a high completion percentage I would be looking for a way to implement it only in certain circumstances (such as a stopped disc).\nWhat is most important; practices or tournaments?\nPractices are more important. Here the captains are able to explain and work on the skills that are important to their offensive and defensive and philosophies. This gives the captains the opportunity to view which players can and will fit into their style of play. It also gives them the opportunity to identify the weaknesses of the tryouts within their structure.\nThe tournament should be more of a confirmation that the player either is capable, or is incapable of performing their role on the team.\nHow should tryouts behave and carry themselves? Some captains and coaches love people that ask a ton of questions, and others want people that want a lot of feedback. Or give their opinions. Or are silent, strong teammates. What are you looking for? Does the personality of a player figure large into whether they can make the team? What about an obnoxious player with tremendous talent?\nAlways ask questions, always ask for feedback. Most of the captains I know are more than willing to provide that feedback.\nIn ultimate, I have found that personalities always figure into whether or not the player makes the team. Two players of equal talent, the one who fits in personality wise with the team will most likely make it over someone that does not fit in well personality wise.\nDoes everyone try out, or are returning players safe?\nOn every team, you know pretty much that the top 10 (or possibly more) will be returning. So it is then up to the captains to let those players who are on the bubble know and tell them what they need to do to make the team.\nIn general, when evaluating the bottom half of the roster, the question I ask is whether or not the tryout would significantly improve the team over a returning player. If the answer is no, then the returner will most likely retain his spot. The reason for this is that the returner has history with the team, understands the offense, defense, and his role on the team. There are a number of intangibles the returner could possibly bring back. But there is always the flip side, so you can never take your position on the team as a returner for granted.\nHow long are your tryouts? Is this optimal?\n6 - 8 practices and includes a tournament so that you can confirm your thoughts on the player.\nIs there anything about the tryout process that you think teams should do more often?\nDuring the tryout process I would like to see teams work on the basic skillset of their tryouts (and their current players included). Then work the skillset into their offensive and defensive philosophies. This allows you to identify areas in which the players excel and where they are lacking.\nFor instance, you might run a hucking drill to see who can actually huck with consistency. You would then explain how the huck drill fits into your offensive philosophy and the types of looks you want to take. This allows you to identify those who can huck, then actually huck in the framework of your offense during scrimmages and tournaments (confirmation) successfully.\n"

  "title": "Thoughts From Team USA Tryouts",
  "author": "Ben Van Heuvelen",
  "issue": "002",
  "content": "My thoughts on this topic are at the front of my mind today!\nAdvice to tryouts:\n1. Distinguish yourself on defense, even if you consider yourself an offensive player. Even if you don\u0026rsquo;t know the offensive system of the new team, you can always make an impression on D. In particular, focus on marks and shut-down defense.\nBe the defender who uses intelligence, positioning, and quickness to prevent his guy from getting open for uncontested passes. Be the defender who visibly hassles/ flusters the thrower with unpredictable movement and energy on the mark. Do not go for poach Ds; do not go for handblocks at the expense of letting off breakmark throws; do not bait layout Ds. Handblocks and layout Ds are flashy, but good captains/coaches will appreciate the flawless fundamentals that make for excellent team defense. (Also, flawless fundamental defense should create plenty of opportunities for flashy big plays.)\n2. Get in shape early. Returning players who feel more assured of their roster spots might not be in great shape yet. You can get an extra few blocks per game, catch an extra few goals per scrimmage, if you\u0026rsquo;re in mid-season shape when everyone else is in early-season shape.\n3. Ask the captains/coaches what they\u0026rsquo;re looking for. Good leaders will articulate, or will be able to articulate, the general qualities they\u0026rsquo;re looking for in players. After a day or so of tryouts, they\u0026rsquo;ll also be able to tell you the type of specific role they envision for you, and what they need to see from you in order to give you a spot on the team.\n4. Play your game and show your skills, but within the structure and the expectations that the team captains set. One way to achieve this balance is to focus on being a player who makes everyone else better. Make throwers look good by catching their swill. Make cutters look good by placing perfect passes to space in front of them (and holstering throws that will not result in perfect passes). Make teammates look good by clearing space. In the course of doing all of these things, you will probably be doing flashy things \u0026ndash; making plays as a receiver, breaking the mark, making long throws. The trick is to keep your focus on doing what makes the team look good, rather than what makes you look good. (Ultimately, they are one and the same.)\n5. Cheer your fellow tryouts as if they\u0026rsquo;re your teammates. One mental pitfall of tryouts is that you focus relentlessly on yourself. You are constantly evaluating how well you\u0026rsquo;re doing. This is dangerous psychological territory. (As Joe Montana said, \u0026ldquo;As soon as you know you\u0026rsquo;re in The Zone, you\u0026rsquo;re not in The Zone.\u0026rdquo;) Take your focus off yourself \u0026ndash; get out of your own head \u0026ndash; by encouraging your fellow tryouts. Talk to them when they\u0026rsquo;re marking, congratulate them when they do good things, etc. (And, as a side-note, do not try to coach or instruct them.) Not only will you have an easier time getting out of your own head and play better, but you\u0026rsquo;ll show the team leaders that you\u0026rsquo;re a good teammate.\n"

  "content": "Horizontal stack offenses have become much more popular in the last decade at the expense of the previously ubiquitous vertical stack offense. Given equivalent talent, which type offense would you rather run in windy situations?\nThis question is one that captains and coaches struggle with each year, and is even more pressing at the club level, where October weather and Florida hurricanes put a premium on moving the disc into the wind. Not long ago, the Condors won a championship in a game with a single upwind point.\nTo guide our panel, we asked the following sub-questions as well:\nWhich offense works better into the wind? With a strong downwind? What about a stiff crosswind? What adjustments can you make strategically in either offense in a very strong (sustained 20-mph +) wind? "

  "content": "Without question, the horizontal offense is a better wind offense. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean it\u0026rsquo;s the right choice for your team. The horizontal offense offers a couple really nice advantages in a high wind situation, but if you don\u0026rsquo;t have the personnel to run it, it\u0026rsquo;ll be worse than a vertical offense. Ben wrote \u0026ldquo;equivalent talent,\u0026rdquo; but I ask what talent?\n(Quick aside: Sockeye and Furious are the two most effective teams at running the horizontal offense, but they are fundamentally different. Sockeye runs the high-tempo, zig-zagging offense I describe here; Furious runs a muscular, isolation, big cut, big throw offense that is a vertical offense in a horizontal disguise.)\nThe horizontal offense opens up the area in front of the disc for aggressive handler cutting. In a windy situation, a five yard leading pass to a handler running across the front of the disc is safe and with the yards-after-catch, an excellent way to advance the disc. The downfield cutting in a horizontal offense is fundamentally different from vertical. Vertical offense relies on long (6-12 yards) cuts to out-muscle and out-run the defenders. Horizontal offense relies on the stop-cut; a quick change of direction cut that relies on the cutter\u0026rsquo;s judgment (\u0026ldquo;which lane do I chose?\u0026rdquo;) and the thrower\u0026rsquo;s ability to break the mark. When it is windy, the long comeback cuts necessary for a vertical offense lead to some nasty and difficult catches. The stop-cut cutter is just beginning to come back when the disc is released and they can adjust and snap on the disc before the defender has time to react. Fronting defense is also much more effective against vertical offense where there is only one comeback cut lane. In the wind, it is easy to front and challenge the thrower to huck it. In a horizontal offense, the cutter is choosing from multiple comeback lanes and the defender can\u0026rsquo;t camp in all of them.\nSo why would you chose a vertical stack offense? A horizontal stack offense is a seven-player offense. For it to really work, everyone has to have a clue. At the high school and college (and some club teams) level, you don\u0026rsquo;t have the luxury of seven people with a clue. Cutting in a horizontal offense really relies on reading the field, finding lanes and knowing your thrower. It is much easier to teach how to run a vertical offense and have it work. Horizontal offense also depends on everyone being able to deliver the disc to every kind of cut. You can play in a vertical offense if you can run and throw a 2-yard dump.\nIn brief, tailor your offense to your talent and adjust to the wind. Don\u0026rsquo;t try to learn two offenses. So, do you have a lot of experience and a lot of quick handlers? Horizontal. Got a couple big throwers and a lot of tall, fast people? Vertical.\n"

  "content": "First and foremost I will say that I am completely biased in favor of a horizontal based offense in a non-windy environment. While there are certain advantages in starting out of a vertical, I believe that a horizontal flow gives players the maximum amount of freedom and space to run the offense. However, in windy conditions (depending on the severity) vertical, if run correctly, does have its advantages.\nProvided that the wind isn\u0026rsquo;t brutal (i.e. less than 20 MPH), I think horizontal is the way to go. Given the athletes that are playing the game today, I think you need to put them in space and let their legs do the work. This offense, when run correctly, is incredibly difficult to stop because it allows tremendous freedom for all players. Cutters can choose to go in or cut deep on a whim, and can also adjust mid-cut if they see a break lane open up.\nWhen attacking downwind defenders are often so worried about getting beaten deep that smart cutters can take twenty-yard unders whenever they choose. And if the defense adjusts, you can let the hucks rain. Obviously any huck-happy offense will face a rise in turnovers, but depending on the wind, and the level of competition, this could be a risk worth taking. Few D-lines will be able to effectively move the disc upwind with any consistency if they have to go the full 70 yards to score.\nWhen attacking upwind you could choose to go either way, but I still like horizontal. For starters, with a correctly run flow you are receiving the disc in the center of the field, not on the sidelines. Even with no wind, the possibility of turnover rises exponentially once the disc gets on the sideline, and with some wind, that percentage gets even higher. Obviously, the disc will eventually find its way to a sideline, but the frequency in which that occurs goes down when flowing horizontally. I also believe (although I know some don\u0026rsquo;t) that throwing break-marks is actually easier in a horizontal, as long as cutters standing on the break side keep potential poachers occupied. And getting breaks going up-wind is huge for eating up chunks of yardage and for allowing the possibility of a break-mark huck. Most likely defenders will be fronting, and if you can get the disc to one of your big throwers on that break side, bomb away.\nWhen dealing with a crosswind, it is imperative that the disc gets to that upwind side (i.e. the side that the wind is blowing from). Again, my bias will be towards horizontal, because I think with a vertical (where the open spaces are towards the outsides of the field) you will find yourself trapped on the down-wind sideline more often that you would like.\nThe vertical stack is true to its name in that it attacks the field vertically. This can be helpful when attacking up wind. For most windy games O-lines will typically find themselves attacking down wind, while the d-lines (provided they force turnovers) will be going up-wind. This means that a team\u0026rsquo;s less offensively talented players (usually) will be asked to score given more difficult circumstances. In this case having an offense that relies on numerous throws, dumps and swings significantly hurts that sides chances of scoring. When attacking the upwind end zone with consistent 20+ MPH gusts, you may want to go vertical. Having played on a team with a very big thrower, this offense can be your best bet to actually get the disc down the field. Try isolating your best deep threat for your biggest thrower and pull the trigger. Obviously this won\u0026rsquo;t work every time, but the chance of completing one longer thrown is often higher than completing 15-20 shorter ones, depending on the personnel. Without the threat of deep throws, defenses will sit on the unders and make it nearly impossible to move the disc, unless your handlers can break the mark consistently.\nThe windier it is, regardless of whether attacking upwind or downwind, but especially upwind, the less likely you\u0026rsquo;ll be to string together dozens of passes to score. Often times the chances of completing one \u0026ldquo;risky\u0026rdquo; throw are higher than completing 20+ \u0026ldquo;safe\u0026rdquo; throws. Take the shot when its there, even if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t pay off the defense will know you\u0026rsquo;re willing to jack it, which will allow for easier unders later in the game.\nAnd, when attacking downwind with a 20+ MPH wind, never turn the disc within your brick. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if the disc goes 80 yards out the back of your opponent\u0026rsquo;s end zone; make them go the full 70 yards to score.\n"

  "content": "Any offense is difficult in the wind, so when conditions are windy a team should play the offense that it has practiced the most. Both vertical and horizontal stack offenses have advantages and disadvantages in the wind and the decision to play one over the other depends on how well your team can be on the same page while running it\u0026rsquo;s O.\nWhen my team first made the transition from vertical stack to horizontal stack back in 2005, we struggled in the wind and often would switch back to the vert stack when it was windy and we were having difficulty scoring. However, that was comparing a vertical stack offense at which we were very experienced to a horizontal offense that we were just learning. At the time, I was convinced that a vertical stack was better in the wind because the emphasis on the lateral disc movement of dumping and swinging made it hard for the defense to overplay the open side, allowing opportunities for cutters to get open with timing and handlers to generate movement with break mark throws. It seemed to me that defenses were able to easily front cutters in our horizontal stack when it was windy and handlers were often left without many options.\nAs my team\u0026rsquo;s horizontal stack has matured and become more dynamic, I now think that it offers more possibilities to advance the disc confidently in windy conditions than the vertical stack. A horizontal offense allows more flexibility for handlers to aggressively attack and get the disc upfield. This not only serves to catch downfield defenders out of position, but it also provides an easy way to advance the disc down the field as the short throws and dishy passes to handlers remain largely unaffected by wind. Additionally, lots of handler motion combined with the coordinated movement of four cutters filling and vacating multiple cutting lanes can find holes in a poaching defense and isolate defenders without help deep. I have found vertical stack offenses to be less effective at breaking down the poachy and clammy defenses that wind invites.\nWhile I would rather play a horizontal offense now, I recognize that its strength lies in the complex combination of coordination and improvisation. I think this may actually take longer for a team to practice before it can effectively execute the offense in any condition than it does for a vertical stack. However, the rewards are greater.\n"

  "content": "To my eyes, the advantage of the spread/horizontal is that you don\u0026rsquo;t need a whole group of people working together, but can be effective by working in just pairs of upfield cutters or on occasion an isolated receiver. Of course, the better teams will have coordination of all the players, but for a young team, or a team using a new system, things can get up and running effectively with the horizontal.\nTo the question as which is more effective in windy situations, again I think you have to look at not the ability of the team, but their familiarity with one another and the system they are using. If a team has a lot of experience working together in a vertical stack system, I think they will make adjustments in the wind that will be very effective. Similar for a horizontal stack, the difference would be in a pickup team, or a team without a lot of practice together, I think the adjustments in a horizontal system are easier to describe and implement for windy conditions than for a vertical system.\n"

  "content": "I am not sure what equivalent talent is but you simply have more options in a HORIZONTAL stack and the cutters are generally all closer to the ball. This is important because all four cutters are options, in and out, almost simultaneously. Additionally, using the field as 4 cutting lanes as opposed to two, for seasoned cutters is easier. The problem is most cutters don\u0026rsquo;t know what they are doing. I think you need to play a lot of Vertical stack to learn how to cut. You must have an understanding of two lanes before you can have four. You must learn to cut for your self (Vertical is a very selfish system) before you can cut for your team. Sure you make space for your teammates by cutting and clearing in a Vertical, but every time you cut you are trying to get open and get a pass. Some cuts in a HORIZONTAL are not designed to get a pass on that throw, but maybe a few throws later.\nGenerally, in high wind you want receivers closer to you. If you have dominant handlers and one or two good cutters you can manage a Vertical, but a HORIZONTAL gives you more options and I think as many options as possible to initiate offense is key. A thrower should always have a minimum of 4 options. In Vertical, unless you are using two dumps, it is hard to design. The HORIZONTAL is designed with the two dumps (though they don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily line up that way) and then I would like to think all 4 cutters could be an option. Even if 2 are, you meet the minimum four.\nWhether up or downwind, I would still stick with the Horizontal\u0026hellip;given a team has the players that have put in the Vertical work. In heavy downwind, the automatic ISO situations initially set up by the HORIZONTAL formation and the 4 lanes produce more turns to cut deep. If the d adjusts, then you can hammer under cuts.\nI would only make general adjustments without specifics about what the other team is doing. Stick to the fundamentals in high wind. Forehands, backhands (maybe some fancy stuff downwind), short passes, throw and go, and keep the ball moving.\n"

  "content": "Given the chess game that\u0026rsquo;s taking place, the O should be keeping the D on their toes equally as much, so I don\u0026rsquo;t know if it\u0026rsquo;s a matter Of which type of O I\u0026rsquo;d \u0026ldquo;rather\u0026rdquo; run. Considering the conditions are windy enough, I\u0026rsquo;d more than likely prefer the Ho stack mainly because I\u0026rsquo;m thinking the D is coming zone or zone for a certain number of passes. If the D looks to transition after 4/5/6 passes, the secondary outside players are already set in place. I also like to look for a potential 2 to 3-man homey/dominator after the D\u0026rsquo;s zone to man transition.\nI think the wind can be the D\u0026rsquo;s 8th man if you\u0026rsquo;re running a vertical stack into the wind. Running a Ho stack is more effective because running dummy cuts or fake cuts to the open side are more believable and the D can\u0026rsquo;t necessarily overplay the open side. Having the ability to opt for a 3-man homey after a call/violation while facing the wind is \u0026ldquo;easier\u0026rdquo; when standing spread O rather than in a stack; it\u0026rsquo;s an easier transition for that matter. Downwind, I\u0026rsquo;d be more flexible to run a vertical stack. In that situation the wind might become the O\u0026rsquo;s 8th man. Dropping a hammer to break side space downwind for example. After feeling out the first few points in a heavy crosswind game, I\u0026rsquo;d be more comfortable running a vertical stack. With the exception of your deep-deep in a zone O, all the players are pretty much where they need to be. I\u0026rsquo;m sure you\u0026rsquo;d be looking at a 1-3-3, a 4-man cup or some sort of heavy trap-side defense for a few passes if not the entire point. That being true, I like having players near to where you want them setup. Allow handlers to be handlers for the first few passes. Maybe they can play a game of catch for the first few passes before the transition; and if not then the wings can get settled and a popper and handler/dump look for a potential 2 on 1 match-up.\nLooking at that kind of wind with either offensive set, the main adjustment I\u0026rsquo;m looking at is really not so different from a no-wind day: you don\u0026rsquo;t need 7 players to score.\nUpwind or downwind: at some point I\u0026rsquo;m looking for the opportunity to use throwers and use speed/quickness to get closer to the end zone.\n"

I find I\u0026rsquo;m generally on a team that\u0026rsquo;s drilled a lot of vertical or drilled a lot of horizontal, so we\u0026rsquo;re better at one particular offence in most conditions.\nAll other things being equal, horizontal relies on using static structure to create space on the field, whereas vertical relies on cutting (dynamic structure?) to create space on the field.\nWind tends to nullify cutting advantages, so theoretically horizontally should be preferred in the wind, all other things being equal, including your team\u0026rsquo;s ability to play either offence.\nHowever, in wind you need to modify the static structure of the horizontal to adjust for the wind direction and strength, and everyone needs to be on the same page, so it could be pretty tricky to get right.\nFor example, obviously, going upwind you need to shorten up the stack to maintain the deep threat, and going downwind you need to lengthen the stack so that you get reasonable return on the in cuts.\nSimilarly, in a side wind you\u0026rsquo;ll probably need to adjust your spacing across the field to allow a greater margin of error on the throws into space.\nBut, just like vertical, it will be more difficult to play horizontal offence in the wind, you need a genuine deep threat at all times, and you need to coordinate your cuts.\n"

  "title": "Talent Determines Offense",
  "author": "Jeff Eastham-Anderson",
  "issue": "001",
  "content": "I would say that the absolute talents of your team will likely favor one offense over the other. If you cannot consistently complete passes greater than forty yards, a stack offense is more favorable than a horizontal. Any situation where the defense no longer has to defend the deep pass puts the horizontal stack offense at a significant disadvantage. This generality can be extrapolated to any situation, not just wind condition. For example, when the disc is on the goal-line, defenders can front the people in the stack, thus using their position to take away the in cut, and the back of the endzone to take away the deep cut. At any point in time your team finds itself unable to throw deep passes, a different offense is called for. Taking this example further, a stack offense, which favors lateral movement of the disc often with break-mark throws, would be more effective on the goal line than a horizontal stack. Conversely, as deep shots become more viable, the horizontal stack would be favored over a vertical one.\nEverybody knows that strong winds make throwing and catching more difficult. This fact is often exploited by defenses by running some sort of zone defense that forces the offense to execute many throws in the hope that somewhere along the line a mistake will be made (see the math section below). But what should be done if a team runs an effective man defense in windy conditions? Every situation is different, but there are a few generalities that can be helpful.\nFirst, the stack must change its position on the field to facilitate the offense\u0026rsquo;s goals. A deep cut from the back of a vertical stack with a stiff upwind may not be viable if the back of the stack is 30 yards away. By the time the thrower recognizes a deep cut from that position is open, the receiver is likely too far way to complete a pass that is uncontested. On the other hand, if the back of the stack is 15 yards away, the thrower has more room to deliver a pass. Alternatively if you are on the downwind side of a stiff crosswind, not only does the stack need to be shallow, but also should move away from that sideline to facilitate line throws, or toward the sideline to facilitate break-mark throws.\nSecond, in windy situations the ratio of risk to reward can be different than when it is calm. Let\u0026rsquo;s say that if it is calm your team can complete 20 short throws at a 100% completion rate to score, or 1 deep throw at a 70% completion rate, then you should take the short throws. However, if you need 30 short throws at a 90% completion rate or 2 deep throws at a 30% completion rate, the math favors deep throws. These numbers are exaggerated to make a point; sometimes a couple big risks are more favorable to a lot of little ones.\n"

  "content": "I guess I\u0026rsquo;m pretty old school on this one. One of the main advantages of the horizontal offense is the deep space it affords throwers, particularly once cutters get the disc in their hands. In a crosswind or upwind situation, deep looks for any thrower become less of an option so I would prefer to run the vertical stack. This usually gives the thrower multiple in looks and I find the dump-swing to be much easier out of a vertical set. To me, dump-swing will win you windy games just by advancing the disc a little bit each time on the swing.\nNow there are some special situations to be addressed here.\nWhat if the disc is trapped on sideline toward which the wind is blowing? This is a tough one. In this situation, the dump-swing is harder and it\u0026rsquo;s even hard to throw to an in cut. One thing to do is while using the dump swing; don\u0026rsquo;t swing it all the way to the sideline creating a trap situation. This also goes for a similar weather situation when playing zone offense. Another thing to consider, particularly in lower level games where more turnovers occur (and particularly in really bad winds) is hucking and playing D.\nWhat if you are going downwind? I actually really like running horizontal or spread offenses in this situation because of the open deep space it creates. Again, if you turn it over on deep looks (where more horizontal turns come), the other team has to work it all the way up, into the wind.\nWhat if you really want to run the horizontal offense/your team doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a vertical stack offense? My advice, much like in a vertical stack offense, is to keep the stack closer to the handlers the windier it is. This forces the defense to still respect deep looks and it also makes handlers\u0026rsquo; jobs easier since they don\u0026rsquo;t have to throw as far to get it to a cutter. On the other hand, if your handlers are particularly strong, you might think about running a handler dominated offense (the cutters wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to stack as close for this) or at least initiate to a handler cutting up field and then to a cutter on the second pass.\n"

  "content": "I want to first analyze what type of team we are and what type of team we are playing in determining which offense (and defense) to run.\nDownwind\nHere I generally prefer the horizontal stack, regardless (and variations), as I feel you a thrower is given more choices from nearly every position. Players also tend to overplay defensively when guarding an O that is going downwind which I feel tends to open up cutters underneath and away more often. Additionally, there is usually plenty of space to put throws out like hammers or scoobers if needed.\nWith the Ho set I prefer to be a bit more aggressive going downwind with hucks (smart hucks though). The reason is that on a huck incompletion, you are now making the defensive team, whose throwers are usually not the best throwers on the team move the disc 70 yards for a goal. Watching the Sockeye/JAM 07 Semi, this appeared to me to be one of deciding factors in the game. Although JAM would generate turns against Sockeye, they were unable to move the disc well against the D and turned the disc back over to Sockeye.\nCrosswind\nHere is where I like to see a hybrid of the two offenses.\nLast year our team focused on playing a horizontal stack to begin the point and moving the disc to the upwind side immediately if there was a crosswind. We did this is because most teams force the disc to the \u0026lsquo;downwind\u0026rsquo; sidelines so that to break the mark you have to throw into the wind. However, if you start on the upwind side, the throws are generally easier, and you are able to move the disc to mid-field before you are stopped. Secondly, the option is there to get off a big throw with a crosswind.\nWhat we didn\u0026rsquo;t do well is then transition to a vertical stack from the horizontal stack after crossing midfield.\nThe reason for moving to a vertical stack near the goal line is that I believe the Ho stack is less effective in scoring goals than the vertical stack in a short field (this could just be dogma as well). I tend to believe that the horizontal stack is better with a lot of field space and that a vertical stack is better with a short field. The reason for this is that teams are able to maintain possession better in a vertical stack offense near the goal line than other offenses as they focus on possession.\nUpwind\nHere I believe you have to go with your strength as a team, which requires an honest assessment of your team\u0026rsquo;s skills and abilities. Two teams stick out over the years is DoG and Furious George, both used different types of offense, but both were very successful.\nIn my view, and from the couple years I saw, DoG ran a stack/iso offense. DoG took the throws that were given to them and were very disciplined in their throws and decision-making. Each player knew their role and executed their offense efficiently, which allowed them to move the disc and take the big throw on what they considered a high percentage throw.\nFurious, on the other hand, had some great throwers who are able to make outstanding hucks upwind to very good receivers and were not afraid to make the big throw. By having great throwers, they were able to maintain the disc until they were able to put up a huck that was a high percentage. (Maybe I\u0026rsquo;m arguing for Ho, but I still feel that both are effective and it depends upon personnel).\nWhere I think that both DoG and Furious are the same is that they ran the same offense on pretty much every possession. Both were excellent and disciplined in executing their strategy.\nAnother team I feel that did both well was JAM 04. Watching the tapes, they were equally adept at running both vertical and a stack offense. The players on the team knew their roles and how to execute their roles very well. This worked to their advantage throughout the series, though whether that hurt them is a question in and of itself.\n1a. See Crosswind. I believe the strategy for the crosswind can be equally effective, if not more effective\n"

  "content": "There are numerous factors to consider when deciding whether to run a horizontal stack (HO) or vertical stack (Vert) offense such as: recent success rate with a particular offense against your opponent, probable individual match-ups with your opponent, and how critical the particular point is. In this scenario we are asked to discuss how another factor, wind, affects that decision. Before that discussion, however, it is necessary to look generally at the relative costs and benefits of the Vert versus the HO offense.\nThe Vert offense is systematic and mechanistic. Teams benefit from its predictability. Everyone knows who is cutting, when he is cutting, and generally where he is going to cut. The thrower knows when and where to look for these cutters. Everyone else sets up subsequent cuts and movements accordingly. The cost of the Vert offense is that it limits the players in the stack who are not scheduled to cut.\nThe HO offense attempts to isolate a number of players at the same time by spreading them across the field. Each of these players have the freedom at any time to take advantage of open cut opportunities\u0026hellip;either in or out. This potential for opportunistic behavior is the benefit of the HO offense. The necessary cost, of course, is decreased predictability. Because cutters are not moving according to preset rules, as in the Vert offense, each one must first decide when and where to cut and must coordinate his decision with every other cutter\u0026rsquo;s decision. Due to this multiplayer decision-making, the thrower cannot expect a cutter in a certain position at a certain time and must therefore find the cutter before making a decision to throw.\nGiven that Vert offense favors predictability at the cost of opportunistic behavior, and that the HO offense favors opportunistic behavior at the cost of predictability, the question now becomes how the wind affects each of these factors. Wind certainly decreases the predictability of any offense. Throwers become tighter and some throws that would be made in calm conditions are unexpectedly withheld in windy conditions. Cutters can also tighten up by hesitating to cut or by staying too long in the lane. This seems to weigh against playing Vert in windy situations. However, wind can also negatively affect opportunistic behavior, especially heading upwind. The probability of completing deep passes decreases going upwind, for example, thus cutting off those opportunities. Since there are more of these opportunities in HO offense, it seems to weigh against playing HO in windy situations. Ultimately, deciding between Vert and HO in wind depends on just how much it affects the predictability of your team\u0026rsquo;s Vert or the possibility for opportunistic behavior in your team\u0026rsquo;s HO.\nMy team, Truck Stop, was a young but very athletic team. Additionally, Truck Stop added a significant contingent of new players, myself included, who needed to build chemistry with the rest of the team. Because of these characteristics we generally played Vert in a strong headwind, but exclusively HO in a downwind situation. It made sense for us to use a HO offense in that situation because everyone can throw further going downwind, making it possible to complete more deep opportunities. We have also utilized some techniques to mitigate the costs of each type of offense. In an effort in institute some predictability into our HO offense; we have a number of set plays that establish the first few cuts off of a pull. These plays help to jump start the offense and settle everyone down for the first few cuts and throws. Similarly, in an effort to take advantage of opportunities in the Vert offense, we have number of plays that initiate cuts from the middle of the stack. For example, if a defensive handler walks to the disc after a turnover and notices that we have a huge height advantage, he can call a play that will send that player deep to take advantage of that opportunity.\nBy evaluating the effect of wind on your team\u0026rsquo;s potential for opportunistic play in the HO and on predictability in the Vert you can chose the offense that will give you the best chance for success in the wind. Furthermore, addressing the shortcomings of these offenses in general with set plays will increase your chances of success.\n"

  "content": "The horizontal stack has all but replaced the vertical stack because it does such a good job of creating space. When run effectively, four cutters typically are spread across the width of the field. This spacing between cutters makes defensive switches very difficult, thereby putting each downfield defender on an island one-on-one with their man. As any cutter will tell you, when you know your defender doesn\u0026rsquo;t have help, you have the advantage. There\u0026rsquo;s no need to sacrifice this advantage just because it\u0026rsquo;s windy.\nIn an upwind situation (offense going into the wind), the biggest problem an offense faces is the defense camping out underneath; always staying between their man and the disc. This makes shorter upfield passes very difficult, particularly in cuts (toward the disc). With the defense taking away the in cuts, it\u0026rsquo;s the deep shots that are left open. But as an offense, you can\u0026rsquo;t solely rely on hitting deep cuts in any weather, let alone against a stiff wind, especially if you don\u0026rsquo;t have throwers with consistently accurate hucks or reliable upwind throws.\nA common mistake horizontal offenses make in the wind is allowing the stack to get too deep (whether consciously or unintentionally). The thought is that if you have more room to make an in cut, the more likely you are to make it successfully and get open for a pass. While this is true conceptually, the strategy really doesn\u0026rsquo;t hold up. You end up limiting yourself to 5-yard-or-so completions and really allow the D to clamp down because they know where you\u0026rsquo;re going.\nInstead, pull the stack in tighter than normal. As an offense, you need to establish that your cutters can get the disc going out as well as coming underneath. Cutters need to do two things: first, keep your spacing across the width of the field - in the wind it\u0026rsquo;s even more important to not allow your man to poach or help on a throw to another cutter. Second, bring your defender in towards the disc as far as he\u0026rsquo;ll go and still stay underneath you. You can do this by starting from a set position in the stack (if you are within 10 yards or so from the thrower) OR begin with an in cut. Either way, turn and go out decisively - don\u0026rsquo;t juke or dance. Throwers: you\u0026rsquo;re looking to get off a pass as soon as the cutter makes his move to go out. Note that this does not need to be a deep pass - and really shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a deep pass unless you\u0026rsquo;re sure you\u0026rsquo;ve got the throw - it just needs to get beyond the cutter. The best throw in this situation is flat with a lot of spin - get it out ahead of the cutter and let him run onto it. Once the D recognizes that you can hit out cuts, they\u0026rsquo;ll have to adjust to play more honestly and not give up that pass so easily. Now you have them respecting both the in and out cuts, and you can start using both effectively.\n"
