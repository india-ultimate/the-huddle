          Sub-calling

        <p>The most terrifying aspect of captaining or coaching, for many players,
is being responsible for deciding who plays, and when. In this issue,
we'll discuss the thought processes that go into making these
decisions.</p>
<p>In this issue of The Huddle we have asked our roster of authors to dish
out advice about strategies for line calling. We gave them a
hypothetical: your team's regular sub-caller is becoming curiously mute
just before Regionals, and must pass on what she knows about sub-calling
to a teammate before she loses her voice completely.</p>
<p>Are there tried-and-true formulas, schemes, and patterns for superior
sub-calling? And who makes the best person to call lines? Answers to
these questions and more.</p>

    <p>Sub-calling is probably the least rewarding aspect of Ultimate. Not only will
you rarely be recognized for good sub-calling, but instead sub-calling is the
easiest thing for many people to blame for problems on the field.
Additionally, problems (real or perceived) with playing time and sub-calling
are often the number one issue affecting team dynamics and player
satisfaction. In my experience, the easiest way to avoid issues with
subcalling is to have a plan ahead of time and to communicate as best as
possible to individuals where their role fits into that plan. A good plan can
then be passed along to someone else who needs to fill in for sub-calling in a
pinch (like losing your voice in a freak scenario). Here&rsquo;s a basic checklist
of questions you can answer when devising your plan:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Which handlers do you want playing primarily offensive points and which do you want playing defensive points? Who do you want to be able to go both ways?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which downfield cutters offer a competitive advantage on O lines or D lines?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which defenders primarily guard handlers? Which are especially good at covering downfielders?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Who fills special niche defensive roles on the team? For example, an
especially tall defender to neutralize the deep threat or an especially good
marker to put on a big thrower.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Divide your handlers up into groups of those who generate offense with their throws (big breaks and/or big hucks) and those who generate offense with their legs (effectively get the disc up-the-line and are always open for resets). You&rsquo;ll want some players from each category on every line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Divide your downfielders into groups of those who can get open with jukes off of a stopped-disc and those who are great at getting open in flow with timing and filling spaces. Again, you&rsquo;ll want some players from each category on every line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there players who have especially good chemistry on the team together?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who are on your special teams? Who are your top zone D players, zone O players, clam defenders, and so on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who are your clutch players? Who do you put in for critical points that are must-score situations on O and/or on D?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the situations that your bottom of the roster performs best in? Being able to utilize your bench players effectively is often the difference between winning and losing in the long run.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, there are a number of different questions you can ask yourself
about your team and its players. The important part is that you are creating
an accurate assessment of your players and how they fit together in various
different situations, so you can create a subbing structure around that and
communicate it to the team. Subbing structures don&rsquo;t need to be super
sophisticated, but having guidelines on how to choose players for each line
will greatly speed up the process for your subcallers, enable them to call
better lines under time pressure, and allow players to better expect when they
are likely to go in or remain on the sideline.</p>

    <p><em>&ldquo;Be careful what you wish for.&rdquo;</em><br>
â€” Ken Dobyns over the phone, NYC to Hampton Bays, August 1995.</p>
<p>Calling the D line that season isn&rsquo;t something I necessarily wished for, but
blindly accepted the vacancy; possibly a dumb move for a not proved new face
on a second year team still fielding much of the leftover NYNY dynasty. We
beat Boston four times that season: Regionals, Tune-up, and two small pre-
season tourneys. And that season we lost two games, both at Nationals: Sockeye
in pool play, and Boston in the semi-finals.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t step up your game, quit calling yourself in!&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>This said with spittle flying everywhere; and that comment is watered down
compared to others heard and learned of later, not to mention the immediate
silence encountered after hobbling down the hall and popping into room 237.</p>
<p>As a spectator in 2002, I hustled over to see the end of the Furious/Boston
semi after Ring defeated Sockeye in the other semifinal. I found myself
standing behind a handful of Sockeye players seated along the sideline. They
were not quite digesting the big let down and were busy chewing on the bitter
pill, calling out the late-game leadership and decision making, dragging
everyone under the bus. All of the trust building drills throughout the course
of the season seemed to be a pitiful waste. Though rotation wasn&rsquo;t the issue,
part of me was them. Weeks before I watched, somewhat helplessly, a 14-10 lead
on Ring and a sure ticket to Nationals slip away as Ring rolled off five for
the win and a spot in the Regional final. The old Gas House Gorillas routine
was certainly overlooked that day.</p>
<p>A place in the sun isn&rsquo;t meant for everyone (and Sockeye&rsquo;s casting a long
shadow), and when the chips fall the other way, a thankless job is, indeed,
thankless.</p>
<p>Be careful what you wish for.</p>

    <p>There&rsquo;s nothing worse than calling a line a finding an uninvited guest has
wandered onto the field. Not only do you have to recall the correct name, but
you have to break the news to the overzealous player and watch them slink off
sadly like Charlie Brown after failing to kick that football. Rats.</p>
<p>To avoid this situation you must speak with the uttermost clarity and
amplification. You mustn&rsquo;t slur your speech; too often names like Sean and
John or Brett and Bren become confused. You mustn&rsquo;t misspeakâ€”say who you mean
and mean whom you say. And finally, you mustn&rsquo;t forget the names of your
players. Nothing is worse than failing to recall (or actually not knowing) a
player on your team. Review the roster list before the tournament. Believe me,
this can be embarrassing.</p>
<p>Beyond basic slips of the tongue, you must be wary of under- or over-counting.
Thou shalt count to seven. No more, no less. Seven shall be the number thou
shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be seven. Eight shalt thou
not count; neither count thou six, excepting that thou then proceed to seven.
Nine is right out. Use your fingers to keep count if you must.</p>
<p>The worst scenario, though, is calling yourself onto the line when you&rsquo;re not
even an eligible to play. You&rsquo;ve graduated, you&rsquo;re washed up, and no one wants
to see your slow, no-defense-playing, sorry ass on the field. The look of pure
disgust and pity you see in the eyes of young men not legally old enough to
drink and barely smart enough to dress themselves is seared indeliably into
your consciousness. Nothing you can do, nothing you can say will restore your
dignity and self-respect.</p>

        <p><a href="/author/greg-husak/">Greg Husak</a></p>
    
    <p>I&rsquo;ve been very fortunate in my career to play on many successful teams that
did not call subs, and this hypothetical situation could be a blessing in
disguise. Most players at elite levels are fairly self-aware, and after a
season of playing together most can recognize the hierarchy within the team
and could make an honest appraisal of their optimum contribution to the team
in terms of quantity and type (O or D) of points.</p>
<p>Some players may have to be told more explicitly ahead of time (and reminded
during a game) but most will have a good idea. At its best, allowing players
to put themselves in the game empowers them to control their contribution, to
put themselves in when they are feeling ready, and gives the rest of the team
confidence in them.</p>
<p>This may not work for every team, but I have been a part of very successful
groups where self-subbing was an ingrained part of the team structure, took
the onus of subbing off one person and distributed it to everyone, and created
an environment of success which pushed each player in practice and games to
achieve their best on the field.</p>

    <p>Sub-calling, especially for one who one who plays at the same time, is one of
the most difficult things to do. Personally, I hate doing it because I feel
like it distracts me from my ability to remain focused while playing. But like
everyone, I always have my own feelings about who should be playing at a
particular time. Fortunately, as captain of my team, my opinion about who
plays carries a bit of weight with the sub-caller. What I&rsquo;ve learned is that
the ideal sub-callers understand that they have a duty to the team rather than
to their teammates, demonstrate objectivity and detachedness in performing
that duty, and have an ability to quickly evaluate changing conditions.</p>
<p>Of course when playing time is not distributed equally, there will always be
someone who is disappointed with the sub-caller&rsquo;s decisions. Dealing with
these types of complaints can be uncomfortable because they require explaining
to a friend why you chose to play someone else instead of him or her. I think
there are four things that the sub-caller has to do in these situations:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Delay the discussion until after the game. Because of everything that a
sub-caller needs to concentrate on during the game, complaints simply cannot
be dealt with until after the game because dealing with complaints would
disrupt effective sub calling.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Listen to the player. Understand exactly what the complaint is. (Does
he believe he is not playing enough? Believe certain types of players are not
playing enough? Believe he is not playing enough at certain times (ie: zone)).
Listening is extremely important because you can tailor you answer to his
concerns. Also, sometimes part of the solution is for the player to know his
concerns have been taken seriously.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Honestly explain the decision to keep that player off the field (you
haven&rsquo;t mastered this offense/defense in practice, you are not in condition,
you were limping that last point and wanted to give you some time to recover,
you displayed a string of bad decisions, the guy who played instead of you was
on fire/had a great match up).</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Identify what that player can work on to fix it. This communication is
very important because it gives the player a clear idea of what he has to
focus on to get better. When he gets better the team gets better.</p>

    <h4><a href="https://the-huddle.indiaultimate.org/issue-009/my-sub-calling-philosophies/" itemprop="headline">My Sub-Calling Philosophies</a></h4>
    
        <p><a href="/author/miranda-roth/">Miranda Roth</a></p>
    
    <p><strong>1.</strong> If you pick the right personnel, there will always be a time when you
can play each player. Think about when these times are for each player on your
team and allow them to excel in these situations.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Be clear to your teammates about the team&rsquo;s sub-calling philosophy. If
it changes for a tournament, don&rsquo;t make it a hush hush operationâ€”let everyone
know so nothing is a surprise.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> When at all possible, have someone who&rsquo;s not playing (a coach or
designated sub-caller, perhaps even an injured player) call subs. Sub-calling
and playing time create the most opportunities for team chemistry to breakdown
and when your playing time, which directly relates to most people&rsquo;s enjoyment
of their playing, is dictated by peers, it can get ugly, fast.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Sub to win. At the elite level, everyone would rather be on a winning
team and play one point per game than be on a losing team and play five points
per game. Or at least we shouldâ€”if people aren&rsquo;t on board with thisâ€”reconsider
their options, which is fine.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Don&rsquo;t get caught up in specialization. I think this may apply even more
to Women&rsquo;s Ultimate than Open Ultimate, but if you have a good player on your
team, don&rsquo;t keep her in the &ldquo;D line&rdquo; or &ldquo;O line&rdquo; or &ldquo;Zone&rdquo; or whatever you
think she is best at if she might be able to help the team in lots of
different situations. The reality is that there will always be turnovers,
teams will always throw different D and O looks, so just play your strong
players that get the job done in all situations and be creative with their
supporting cast.</p>

  <div class="post" id="practical-considerations">
    <h4><a href="https://the-huddle.indiaultimate.org/issue-009/practical-considerations/" itemprop="headline">Practical Considerations</a></h4>
    
        <p><a href="/author/adam-goff/">Adam Goff</a></p>
    
    <p>When I was calling subs, I also usually was calling the &ldquo;strategy&rdquo; for the
points. (Are we playing zone? Are we setting horizontal? Is this point the
most critical point ever?). That helped me when it came to determining players
based on the roles needed. It also made me pretty tired by the end of the day.
How these decisions are made on your team will help dictate who should call
subs when the sub-caller goes down with a freak throat injury (Larynxeum
andibenitis). For example, if there are two people who call the O and two
people who call the D, can one of them handle the sub-calling as well? That
will simplify the discussions, and it will help with establishing authority
for the sub-caller. If this is not as strict (is it just a leader on the field
who does it?), then I would suggest establishing a short discussion prior to
each point to set that down. That discussion should be 5 seconds or less.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a suggested transcript:</p>
<p><strong>Sub-Caller:</strong> What&rsquo;s the D?<br>
<strong>Strategy Person:</strong> Clam for five to backhand.<br>
<strong>Sub-Caller:</strong> Ok, (seven names) you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>It is within the idea of strategy that some of the subtleties that I believe
are the hardest to convey to a new sub-caller appear. A few examples:</p>
<p>- It&rsquo;s double game point and we&rsquo;re receiving. Perhaps one of my top handlers
is also one of my higher risk handlers (bigger throws, less prone to
possession) or maybe one of my top handlers has a habit of tightening up on
the big points. Do I need that person on the field or is it too high a risk at
that point in the game?</p>
<p>- The other team is kicking our butts by sending out three tall receivers,
but it&rsquo;s the mark getting broken that is setting up the throws. Do I need my
best markers or tallest players (or both)?</p>
<p>Given the parameters of the question, I bring out a pad of paper and a pen for
stuff like this. The strategy leadership needs to pass this information to the
sub-caller. This needs to be communicated during the game, and the number of
people who are allowed to talk to the sub-caller about this has to be limited
for a new one. That needs to be established prior to the weekend with the
entire team.</p>
<p>Sub-calling starts early in the season and lasts throughout the year. This
doesn&rsquo;t just mean the act of calling out names between points, but rather
consists of preparing people for the role that they will play, ensuring that
they know that role and clearly communicating expectations throughout the
year. If the fourth person down the depth chart of O handlers who has never
played a D point actually expects to go in when you&rsquo;re pulling at 14-14 in the
semis of regionals, that&rsquo;s a personal problem. Sub-callers and captains need
to ignore that at all points at Regionals. It&rsquo;s more likely that someone who
is down the depth chart a bit starts to think that they should be playing more
at the end of games. This is still a personal problem, not a team one. It only
becomes a team problem if it distracts leadership from their roles. If I&rsquo;m
training a new sub-caller, I tell them that during the game is not the time
for this, and they just need to send that person to me or to a different
captain at that point. The sub-caller can&rsquo;t spend time on it. No need to yell
at this person, but the sub-caller needs to simply-and-firmly tell the person
to go away until after the game. Then, I&rsquo;d suggest that the person only talk
to the captain, and the captain talks to the sub-caller (assuming they are
different people). That message also needs to go to the entire team before the
weekend. Captain to team: &ldquo;Billy-Jean will be calling subs this weekend. Do
not insert yourself into this process. If you have a problem with this, talk
to me. If Billy-Jean asks you to do something, play or sub out, do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Most teams have defined positions or roles (O/D, handler/upfield, more
points/less points, zone breakers, upwind players), and the general theory of
the team has likely been discussed prior to the week of Regionals
(fortunately). The sub-caller should understand these key principles and who
fits into what roles. A hierarchy can be important to understand as well. Some
teams seemed to have a group of individuals who can self-sub (Did it look like
DoG was calling subs on offense when they were winning? Or did 7 people just
kind of wander out on to the field and then score?). The sub-caller absolutely
has to know who can and cannot do that and has to have the confidence and
strength of personality to stop those who can&rsquo;t do it and sometimes stop those
who can do it.</p>
<p>When I called subs for teams, I kept a sheet of who had played how many
points. I changed organization of the sheet depending on the team, but:</p>
<p>- For teams which were almost exclusively O/D, I would split the list that
way. This presented some challenge for the few players who did play both, but
it was helpful. Then, within the groups I split handlers and upfield cutters.</p>
<p>- For teams which were not as heavily O/D, I split handlers and upfield. This
is what I did almost always. I expected some variance, but usually wind, the
type of O or D, the situation dictated which of those groups I needed more
than anything else.</p>
<p>I would refer to the sheet occasionally through the game, but not necessarily
on every line call. I also had others helping keep the sheet filled out so
that I could pay attention to how the game was going. I asked those people to
tell me things like: if a key player has played four or more points in a row
early in a game, if a player we&rsquo;d need at the end of the game hadn&rsquo;t played in
six or more points, and so on. Just those things are enough to help guide what
needs to be done. When I coached, I did the same thing. In addition to the
points-sheet, it&rsquo;s useful for a new sub-caller to have a sheet which has the
roles and hierarchy. For example, that sheet might have four sections:
Vertical O, Horizontal O, Person D, Zone D. That&rsquo;s the playbook. Laminate it
and tape it to the sub-callers arm. Within each section, it would list in
order of hierarchy, handlers then upfielders. That&rsquo;s the sheet that person
would use most often. I didn&rsquo;t actually carry this, as I felt that I knew it
by the time it mattered, but if someone is doing it for the first time at
Regionals, it will help.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t keep turnovers, O/D or other information on the points sheet, because
that was simply more information than I could process while making decisions.
If others put the information on the sheet, I thanked them nicely and then
ignored it. It&rsquo;s good information to have when evaluating how things went, but
just too much for the heat-of-the-moment. Some people may be able to process
all of that information, but I kinda doubt it. My feeling was that, unless a
key player was having the type of hellish game that was obvious to everyone,
that person didn&rsquo;t sit more when it mattered. Play time is usually earned over
a season, not in the 1 vs. 16 game at Regionals. Likewise, if a player down
the depth chart had earned more points, it&rsquo;s obvious.</p>
<p>One special situation: Let&rsquo;s say my team is pretty much O and D split. Let&rsquo;s
say the O isn&rsquo;t getting it done. We had a three point lead. The handlers seem
spent and we&rsquo;ve turned it over two in a row, and it&rsquo;s now tight. My D line has
2 of my best handlers on it. Do I put the two D guys in with the rest of the O
line? Do I put seven from in the D line to play O? To oversimplify the answer:
If I practice almost entirely split between the lines or if my D plays O
differently than my O, I put in the D line. Otherwise, I put in the D handlers
with the O line.</p>
<p><em>Special Mixed Note:</em> I&rsquo;ve seen a number of teams that have a woman sub-caller
and a male sub-caller. Those two tend to work together on some teams and
independently on other teams. I think it&rsquo;s natural that the players are aware
a bit more of their gender on the field. It&rsquo;s important that the &ldquo;new&rdquo; sub-
caller get with the other sub-caller in this situation and understand when to
and when not to worry about what the other one is doing. Both are still
subservient to the strategy role, but they need to know how the roles work
together.</p>
<p>And a final point about picking a sub-caller: some people with all the skills
(confidence, authority, perception, know the players, see the game) can&rsquo;t
manage to call subs and play at their top level. Some can, but some just
can&rsquo;t. If someone struggles to focus on their own game when they are calling
subs, that person can really only be the sub-caller if they don&rsquo;t have to play
at all. Perhaps the editors can twist an ankle on that person and make this
assignment easy? <em>(Editor&rsquo;s Note: No.)</em></p>

        <p><a href="/author/matt-dufort/">Matt Dufort</a></p>
    
    <p>First things firstâ€”calling subs for a competitive team is a big job. It will
take a lot away from anyone&rsquo;s playing ability. There may be someone out there
who can play at their best and call subs at the same time, but I haven&rsquo;t met
them. Because of this, I think it&rsquo;s better to split sub-calling duties between
two or three players, or expect that the person calling subs is not going to
play very much.</p>
<p>To me, the most important element of sub-calling is being prepared. You should
know pretty well before the tournament starts who&rsquo;s going to play, how much,
and in what situations. You need to leave room for adjustment based on how
each person is playing at the moment, but having an idea beforehand is a huge
help.</p>
<p>Sub-calling sheets are great. A simple grid works well, with the players
listed on the side, and points across the top. You can easily see how many
points each person&rsquo;s played, how long they&rsquo;ve been in or out. Grouping
handlers, cutters, defenders together also helps. It&rsquo;s pretty easy to add
basic stats to such a grid, and to get your next line ready during the point.
In a game with strict time limits, you should ideally have an O line and a D
line ready before the point ends. If you need to change one or two people,
that&rsquo;s much easier than picking a full seven.</p>
<p>When it comes to picking players for each line, subbing should be strategic,
over the course of the game and the tournament. If your defense is forcing
lots of turnovers but having trouble scoring, you can bring over a more
offensive-minded player. In general, you want your best players to be in when
you need them, but rested enough that they&rsquo;re still going strong in finals or
that last backdoor game of Regionals. This strategy will vary depending on
your team&rsquo;s composition, but here&rsquo;s one example of what I mean.</p>
<p>For many of its years at the top of the Open ultimate scene, Furious George
has been a top-heavy team. Their best five or six players were better than
anyone else&rsquo;s, and they knew it. But they couldn&rsquo;t play those guys every
point, so most of the time they&rsquo;d mix them in with role players (who were,
granted, also very good). A couple times a game, they&rsquo;d put most or all of
their strongest players in for one defensive point, with the intention of
getting a break on that one point. It usually worked. Against the consistent
offenses in the elite game, defensive breaks are enormously important. One
break can be the difference between a win and a loss, and a huge momentum
swing. By targeting particular points for breaks, Furious George was able to
maintain a high level of play throughout games and tournaments, but bring it
up one big step when it counted the most.</p>

    <p>It is a big point midway through a big game at the most important high school
elite open tourney of the year. The opposing team has taken a timeout between
points. You look at the team you coach to figure out what line you want in the
game. You know that a number of your kids haven&rsquo;t been in the game yet and
that they paid a lot of money to make the plane trip. Oh, and there are those
same kids&rsquo; parents who also came along and have been making runs to the store
all weekend to make sure the team has everything that they need. You&rsquo;ve been
coaching some of those kids since middle school and you&rsquo;ve known the parents
for years because you coached their other child. Some of those great kids who
haven&rsquo;t played yet are seniors who played on JV for three years and have been
waiting for the chance to make the difference in helping the varsity win a
championship. Because you work with your feeder programs as well, you notice
that some of those other kids who haven&rsquo;t played are a couple of the freshmen
who were the stronger players on the 8th grade team last year. Those freshmen
love to compete and are going to be a big part of the team somewhere down the
road. They are dying to get into the game to show they can make plays at
important times in high school games. Everybody is looking at you with hopeful
eyes of helping the team succeed. What do you do?</p>
<p>There are a lot of pressures on coaches. Calling subs is one of those
pressures. It is true in every team sport. Determining who actually gets to
play can be very distasteful. It probably ranks third in the down sides of
coaching behind a player getting seriously injured and having to cut people
from the team. The question is: &ldquo;How do you deal with subbing to help the team
succeed?&rdquo; Subbing is not a decision that is made in a vacuum of just this
particular point. There is always the bigger picture of keeping morale high,
keeping people invested in the program, keeping parents happy, and keeping the
administrators off your back. And the truly odd thing is that winning does not
cure all ills in a program. You can win championships and still be hammered on
your evaluations because winning isn&rsquo;t everything even when losing is
unacceptable.</p>
<p>Back to the game. What do you do? Simple. You tell your power line and power
rotation that they are in the game and that they are not coming out until the
game is over or the other team obviously gives up. Are the players who haven&rsquo;t
gone in yet mad because they may not get to play in this game? How mad are the
parents who came to watch their kid play and their kid probably won&rsquo;t go in
the game? The answer is that people might be a little disappointed which is
natural and even desirable (you certainly don&rsquo;t want too many kids on the team
who want to sit out the big points), but the bottom line is that every player
on the team knows his role, as do the parents, because you have properly
prepared them for this moment.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the season the coach needs to communicate with everyone
about the expectations of being on the varsity team and what it means.
Experienced coaches know the importance of putting it in writing, announcing
it at the team parent meeting, and repeating it often at practices and games.
Also, before and after every game you start your speech by pointing out how
important the players who are not getting or did not get in the game are to
the success of the team. You don&rsquo;t say this to be nice, you say it because it
is true. It is both a clichÃ© and very overlooked that being a team player is
of huge value. Your chances of succeeding are vastly increased if the players
who don&rsquo;t get much, if any, playing time, are as excited or more excited than
the players on the field when the team has success. Those role players have
very important roles in practices and games that are often overlooked by those
people only watching the games. One of the great things about ultimate is that
players on the sidelines can actually help the team succeed by communicating
important info to the players on the field.</p>
<p>Back to the game. Is the power line ready to go in? Do the players in the
power rotation who are not in know that they are in the tighter rotation of
people playing these next all important points? Of course they do. You have
practiced and played with this rotation already in both practices and games.
Plus you have it written down on your subbing rotation sheet.</p>
<p>So why rotations and not calling lines? There is the issue of players knowing
what to expect in situations so they can be prepared mentally. There is the
issue of a coach trying to call lines and make strategy adjustments at the
same time that just leads to the wrong players on the field and not so great
adjustments. And yes, coaches want to control the subs and the adjustments.
(There are two kinds of coaches when it comes to control. Those who are
obviously control freaks and those who are good at hiding that they are
control freaks). So, how do you get the right players on the field at the
right time while still being able to make strategy adjustments on the fly?
Well it obviously helps to have good assistant coaches who know what the plan
is, can take charge AND do not get flustered when the head coach overrules
them with an adjustment. But more importantly you have set up your rotations
beforehand.</p>
<p>It can be as simple as ranking your players as ones, twos, or threes, with
ones being your strongest players. Usually you will have equal numbers of ones
and twos with only a couple of threes. You add an &ldquo;H&rdquo; for the handlers. You
then sort by rank. (I prefer a spreadsheet.) You communicate with everyone
about their rank and you practice with different rotations. The rank includes
both offensive and defensive talent. In HS elite ultimate you can generally
figure out how to make sure your least able defensive player on the field
doesn&rsquo;t mark up against the other teams&rsquo; strongest offensive players. And
every kid on the team knows how to throw resets and easy scores (and to know
the difference between an easy score finish and a not-so-easy score finish) if
they get the disc on offense and are not a primary handler.</p>
<p>Different kinds of rotations (Ones will rotate in for ones, twos for twos, and
threes for threes, in all rotations):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standard Rotation:</strong> 1h, 1h, 1, 1, 2h, 2, 3</li>
<li><strong>Even Rotation:</strong> 1h, 1h, 1, 2h, 2, 3, 3. (This can also be 1h, 1, 2h, 2h, 2, 3, 3)</li>
<li><strong>Power Rotation:</strong> 1h, 1h, 1h, 1, 1, 1, 1 (Don&rsquo;t save the power rotation for late in games. Use it to get an early lead, to get the important breaks, to end a big game as quick as possible in tournament play)</li>
<li><strong>2/3 Rotation:</strong> 2h, 2h, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3. (This group has practiced against the power rotation so they are comfortable playing together. If the power rotation has just run off four or five points against an opponent, put this rotation in and tell them they stay in until they give up a score.)</li>
<li><strong>Fun rotations:</strong> Tall, Short, Seniors, 9/10, Soccer, Basketball.</li>
</ul>
<p>If all goes well and you picked the correct rotations and made the proper
strategy adjustments you have put your team into a position where they have
found success on the field. It is not quite over yet, you still have to make a
good post game speech where you will mention the role players first and stress
how important they were to the success of the team. And when one of the
parents who has been working hard for your program and whose kid didn&rsquo;t play
in the big game comes up to you and says, &ldquo;Hey coach, I asked my son how he
felt about not playing in that game and he explained to me that he was okay
with it because he knew his role and feels that he helped the team succeed as
much as the guys who were in the game. Nice job coach. I&rsquo;ll see you this
summer. My son is really looking forward to improving his skill set.&rdquo; Well,
you know that you will probably get to keep your job for another year. You get
three days before the high of winning the tournament wears off. Four days from
now you get to start thinking about next year by looking at the rotation
sheets to see how many points each kid played and what needs to be done for
next year.</p>

        <p><a href="/author/lou-burruss/">Lou Burruss</a></p>
    
    <p>Here are a couple little tricks that can really help you out.</p>
<p>This first technique is something I&rsquo;ve never done, but I&rsquo;m still gonna name
it. Let&rsquo;s call it Repeater. I saw it first at College Nationals this year,
where Syzygy was using it (they crushed us) and I later overheard teams using
it at Solstice (Eugene) and HoDown (Calgary). Basically, your sub caller yells
out the names just as usual and then everyone repeats them. &ldquo;Beth.&rdquo; &ldquo;BETH!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Kate.&ldquo;&ldquo;KATE!&rdquo; And so forth. It&rsquo;s really a wonderful piece of technology. It
focuses your team on the point ahead and helps avoid that dratted looking-for-
someone-on-the-sideline-and-yelling-their-name business. This technique does
require that your sub caller have a decision very quickly, but you can always
make on the line changes after the seven are out there.</p>
<p>This second technique is one that I&rsquo;ve used twice and each time it was
incredibly effective. You almost always (particularly in women&rsquo;s) have a
player with a season ending injury. Have them call subs. I had a sophomore
(Jinny Eun of Riot) do this for Syzygy the year we won. Did she know what she
was doing at the beginning of the season? Absolutely not. Did she know what
she was doing at the end of the season? Definitely. It takes a lot of work on
the part of a coach or a captain to teach someone to call subs, but it is
absolutely worth it. Obviously, this person doesn&rsquo;t have to be a rookie. This
past year for Oregon, one of our captains (Gordy) blew her knee out and
immediately took over from me as main sub caller. As a coach or captain, you
are freed from the tyranny of the clipboard. Free to actually coach or play.
Then, subbing becomes one more area of oversight, like play-calling or defense
or analyzing the other team&rsquo;s best player.</p>
<p>Remember, the best sub caller is Victory and the worst sub caller is Defeat.</p>

  <div class="post" id="the-pod-system">
    <h4><a href="https://the-huddle.indiaultimate.org/issue-009/the-pod-system/" itemprop="headline">The Pod System</a></h4>
    
        <p><a href="/author/mike-whitaker/">Mike Whitaker</a></p>
    
    <p>Sub-calling is one of the most difficult parts of being a team leader, be it
as a coach or a player. As coach of Kali (the University of Colorado Women&rsquo;s
team), I have employed several different strategies throughout the years
depending on the team. In this article, I&rsquo;ll try to give young players some
insight into one coach&rsquo;s perspective of sub-calling.</p>
<p>My sub-calling strategy begins in the organization of my sub sheet. I split
players into pods, generally four or five.</p>
<p><strong>Pod 1â€”Veteran Handlers:</strong> As a coach, I realize that our chances of scoring
increase significantly if there are at least two confident throwers on the
line.</p>
<p><strong>Pod 2â€”Veteran Cutters &amp; Defenders:</strong> These are my athletes who I trust in
their knowledge of the game and defensive ability but may not be as
comfortable with the disc.</p>
<p><strong>Pod 3â€”Young Handlers:</strong> These are the next generation handlers who may not
have all the skills or confidence yet to touch the disc all the time, but are
likely to develop into good handlers given enough touches.</p>
<p><strong>Pod 4â€”Young Cutters &amp; Athletes:</strong> These are my first or second year players
who seem to &ldquo;get it&rdquo; and have an idea of where to go on the field and when to
go there, but aren&rsquo;t consistent yet with their skills.</p>
<p><strong>Pod 5â€”Rawest rookies:</strong> This pod contains the players who are very new to
the sport and may tend to get a little lost or confused on the field at times
due to the game being so new.</p>
<p>My use of the pods changes based on the opponent. In games against inferior
opponents where the score is unlikely to be close, I tend to sub liberally and
pull 3-4 players per line from Pods 1-2 and 3-4 players from Pods 3-5.</p>
<p>In games that are more competitive, I try to not have more than one player
from Pod 5 on the field at one time. I tend to give more points to Pods 1-2
with 5-7 of them on the line at a time for offensive points. Occasionally I&rsquo;ll
mix in pod 3-4 players with veteran throwers or cutters to give some rest.
More frequently, I would put in an entire line of young players to give rest
to all of Pods 1-2 at the same time. They play defense and are given chances
to work together as a unit at practice prior to the tourney. Their job is to
make life difficult for the opposing O and hopefully score, but making the
other O work hard was the primary goal. If we can steal points with this line,
all the better. Basically, I &ldquo;go for&rdquo; some D points by loading up with Pods
1-2 and then hope to get a couple of points out of the younger D line
throughout the game.</p>
<p>By using this pod system, I attempt to keep my veterans fresh for late in the
tourney when they may have to play multiple points in a row while keeping
young players involved in the action and giving them an opportunity to take
ownership of making a difference in the game. The best way for a young player
to increase playing time in this system and move from say Pod 4 to Pod 2 is
for her to exert effort on D, catch the disc, and complete the next pass
consistently.</p>
